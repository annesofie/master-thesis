\section{Future work}

Create a survey to test how accurate both experienced and inexperienced participants digitize buildings from aerial images. Can use FKB as the correct polygon and compare it with the drawn polygon from participants. 

Do a study with reward. Compare reward and not reward geo tasks. Do they solve the tasks better with reward? "A reward can be provided for merely participating in the task. The reward can also be provided as a prize for submitting the best solution or one of the best solutions. Thus, the reward can provide an incentive for members of the community to complete the task as well as to ensure the quality of the submissions."  %https://www.google.com/patents/US9305263
