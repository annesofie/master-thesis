\section{Future work}

Create a survey to test how accurate both experienced and inexperienced participants digitize buildings from aerial images. Can use FKB as the correct polygon and compare it with the drawn polygon from participants. 

Do a study with reward. Compare reward and not reward geo tasks. Do they solve the tasks better with reward? "A reward can be provided for merely participating in the task. The reward can also be provided as a prize for submitting the best solution or one of the best solutions. Thus, the reward can provide an incentive for members of the community to complete the task as well as to ensure the quality of the submissions."  %https://www.google.com/patents/US9305263

\section{Usage potential}
Systems are exploiting the people's physical presence in an environment more, they are more location dependent. This can be particularly important when seeking to improve geospatial data quality [\citep{Meier2013}, p. 323]. "For instance, UrbanMatch (Celino et al. 2012a ) is a mobile location based game that uses playerâ€™s familiarity with a city to link photos with points of interest in the city. Players are shown points of interest and known images from a trusted source (e.g. OpenStreetMap) and asked if photos from an untrusted source (e.g. Flickr) might also relate to the point of interest ".  

\citep{Meier2013}:  "As the previous sections show there is a lot of potential for AR systems to use HC to provide content, and to support processing in other ways. However there has been
little research to date combining AR and HC systems. In this section we review the first research efforts in this area. "
