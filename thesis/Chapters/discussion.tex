\chapter{Discussion}
%As shown in this thesis, micro-tasking is used in projects that wish to exploit human computation and a huge crowd, through for instance crowdsourcing. This thesis study if micro-tasking can or should expand to involve interactive maps and geospatial data. In OpenStreetMap, it has become a dominant method, both in mapping jobs and imports jobs \citep{Erichsen2016}. The methods popularity in OSM confirms the potential of expanding micro-tasking to the geo-community. The research questions tested is: 1) Is it possible to give micro-tasks containing geospatial data to inexperienced workers? 2) Will the quality of the solved task increase with fewer elements present in each micro-task? 3) What are the number of elements optimal within a micro-task to get it completed as quickly as possible?
Our results have found support for the possibility of giving geospatial micro-tasks to all individuals, independent of background. There was statistically significant evidence that inexperienced participants finished the tasks faster than experienced participants, this is also shown in figure \ref{fig:meanstdparticipantstime}. The mean time difference was 16 seconds, a statistically significant, but relatively small difference. \cite{Gadiraju2015a} demonstrated that using a proper training section decreased the task completion time with up to 41\%. An assumption is that inexperienced participants followed the instruction video and training task more carefully than experienced participants. One would expect experienced participants to finish the tasks faster since they are familiar with map interaction and interpreting base maps and meta information. The training section was maybe enough to eliminate the inexperienced uncertainty towards the tasks, making them just as fast as the experienced. The author also suspects the experts not to use the training section thoroughly, resulting in them completing the tasks slower than the non-experts. 

During the pilot test, the author noticed that the experienced participants used the map aids given in question one more frequently than inexperienced. The map aids were zoom, panning and a layer control to show/hide the building footprints. Without the aids the participants could not see the shape of the building on the base map, so they were important to use. A possible explanation for the time difference is that the experienced participants spent more time using the map aids provided since they are more familiar with them and knew how to use them. Using the aids more frequently to investigate the base map and layers more thoroughly to be more confident in their answers. It is a possibility of them executing the tasks more complicated than necessary. The experienced individuals have most probably solved much more complex tasks and maybe compares the micro-tasks with similar and more advanced tasks. They then overestimate the complexity resulting in them spending more time on each micro-task.

When analyzing the number of correctly chosen elements between experienced and inexperienced participants, the difference is not statistically significant. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdparticipantscorrect} show a very similar mean value between them. Inexperienced participants had a mean of 9.83, while experienced had a mean of 9.81 correct elements. One would expect that inexperienced participants had fewer correct elements since they spent less time on the tasks. \cite{Salk2016} results also observed minor differences between the professional and non-professional participants. They concluded that professional background had a limited first-order relationship with task accuracy. It can be argued that the introduction video and training task remove the effect of having a professional background. Training made the micro-tasks understandable for everyone so that professional background had no effect on the quality of the task results. \cite{Gadiraju2015a} showed that with a training section the task quality increased up to 5\%. A 5\% quality increase can be enough to remove the differences in task performance between experts and non-experts. \cite{See2013} also concluded that with proper targeted training material the differences between experts and non-experts could decrease. A conclusion that matches this thesis results well. 

The splitting of participants into experienced and inexperienced was based on the question "Do you have experience of working with geospatial data?". Other studies ask the participants for background information through a registration procedure. \cite{See2013} and \cite{Salk2016} considered people with a background in remote sensing/spatial science as experts, and people who were new to the discipline or had a self-declared limited background as non-experts. In this study, the participants are self-declared experts / non-experts. It is not possible to validate this information. In the pilot-test we knew the background of the participants, they answered yes and no on the experience question as the author anticipated. With this observation, we conclude that overall the participants correctly declared themselves as experienced / inexperienced.

There were minor differences between the three tasks. Results found no statistical support for faster completion time with fewer elements. Time spent completing each task was approximately the same. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123time} show a slightly faster task completion on task A, but not a statistically significant difference according to \textit{Tukey's test}. Experienced participants finished task B fastest (figure \ref{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123time}) and inexperienced finished task A fastest (figure \ref{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123time}) but this is also not statistically significant. The small differences in time show that participants found all three tasks manageable to solve. Fewer elements in the micro-tasks did not reduce the task completion time.

One can question the time variable because it does not reflect how much time the participant spent in front of the screen from task start to task end. It reflects how much time passed when solving the two questions or micro-tasks. It can be argued that the participants spend more time on task A in total. Time spent switching to the next question and fetching the next task element is not added to the time variable. In total the participant probably spent more time in front of the screen doing task A compared to task C. In task C all six task elements are present, so the participants did not have to wait for the web application too, i.e., fetch the next task element. The Los Angeles building import used another strategy. Their approach can be described as a combination of task A and task C. The buildings were imported one by one, but in their solution, all buildings covering a selected area was visible on the map at the time time. The map window highlighted one and one building, guiding the workers through every building. This made it easier for the micro-tasking workers to concentrate on each building and at the same time have all elements available. This approach eliminates time spent fetching and switching to the next building footprint on the map, but at the same time probably keeps the task performance high. Future studies should look closer on this task approach.

Looking at the quality of the task results, task A is statistical significantly better than the two other tasks according to \textit{Tukey's test}. Our results have found support for the quality to increase with fewer elements present in the task, also shown in figure \ref{fig:meanstdtask123pngcorrect}. Using the figure and table \ref{tab:totalcorrect_tasks}, participants had in average one more correct element in task A compared to the two other tasks. Participants did worse on task C, but the difference is small. Experienced participants got better results on task A, and this was also statistically significant. Inexperienced participants also got the best results on task A, but this is not statistically significant. The quality of task results was more even in the three tasks for inexperienced than experienced participants. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123correct} and \ref{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123correct}. 

%Figure \ref{fig:splittedbymeanage} show mean task quality for the three different tasks, divided by the participant's average age (31.5 years). The youngest participants did better on all three tasks. Task A has the highest task quality in both groups. Looking at the participants above mean age, \ref{fig:olderthan31correct}, task C has poorer quality. Older participants struggle more on micro-tasks with six elements than three and one elements. Inexperienced participants had an average better quality on task C than the older, but this statement is not statistically tested. 

Task A had an average difficulty rating of 2.11, task B of 2.14 and task C of 2.5. Experienced participants gave a lower difficulty score than inexperienced on all three tasks (in average a 0.20 lower difficulty score). All scores are surprisingly low. In the "after each survey" form, score one was described as easy and score five as hard. It is clear that the participants overall found the tasks manageable to solve. 

%The author neglected the motivation factor in the experiment. Gamification and payments are frequently used motivation factors, as shown in chapter \ref{chp:background}. Do a study with reward. Compare reward and not reward geospatial tasks. Do they solve the tasks better with reward? 

%Create an experiment to test how accurate both experienced and inexperienced participants digitize buildings from aerial images. A solution can use the Norwegian FKB data as the correct polygon and compare it with the drawn polygon from participants. Many countries do not have accurate building datasets and such an dataset can be used to train machine learning algorithms to recognize buildings in aerial images. 
One can question how realistic the experiment application is compared to a real micro-tasking situation. The main difference is the absence of motivation factors in the experiment. The author decided to neglect these factors. Gamification and payments are frequently used motivation factors, as shown in chapter \ref{chp:background}. There is likely a difference between a curious participant joining the experiment and, i.e., an MTurk worker who gets paid per completed micro-task. To achieve a perfectly realistic study the micro-tasks used in the experiment could be posted on a micro-tasking platform, i.e., MTurk or CrowdFlower. Using a micro-tasking platform would require funds to pay the workers, which is something this master thesis did not have. Another strategy could be to create a game-like approach as Luis von Ahn did through, i.e., "The ESP game" (section \ref{sec:humancomputation}). Solving the micro-tasks though a game would exploit the motivation factor. A game would probably be challenging to distribute and get people to invest time playing it. A new, unknown game is not easy to distribute and would also demand much time and effort to develop. 

Much of the work the OpenStreetMap community has made around micro tasks so far has been correct. They are fixing geometry errors through a gamification approach using micro-tasking. They also divide large import tasks into smaller tasks distributing them on their micro-tasking platform (section \ref{sec:taskingmanager}). What the author evaluate as missing knowledge in OSM, is partitioning the large tasks. This was a problem OSM encountered during the New York building import. The import dataset was divided into predefined regions, containing different building density. This gave a huge deviation between the number of elements in each micro-task. The tasks could not be distributed to all workers on the Tasking Manager platform, because of the time and resources spent training new workers (shown in section \ref{sec:buildingimport}). One can question that each micro-tasks incorporated too many buildings, making the tasks too complex. Neither of the three tasks given in this experiment was considered as too complex by the participants when evaluating the difficulty score. The author would recommend dividing a large task by a predefined number and not by predefined regions as both import jobs mentioned in section \ref{sec:buildingimport} did.

%A master thesis written in spring 2017 investigated how building information could be extracted from remotely sensed images by developing a machine learning algorithm. The FKB building dataset\footnote{A detailed building dataset covering Norway} together with aerial images created the training dataset. A problem the author met was that the aerial image and FKB buildings were from different years and there was no obvious way to filter the buildings on the year they were built. The consequence of this was that buildings in FKB didn't exist on the areal image, which give contradictory information and weakens the algorithm \citep{Orstavik2017}. Micro-tasking could have solved this problem, creating a valid training dataset. A perfect example of how  machine learning can exploit micro-tasking.
