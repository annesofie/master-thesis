\chapter{Methodology and experiment}
%This thesis will try to determine questions regarding micro-tasks involving geospatial data. 
There is little research on how inexperienced individuals solve micro-tasks when the tasks involve map interaction. To the authors best knowledge, little, if any, research has been conducted on micro-tasks involving geospatial interpretation and analysis. An experiment will be carried out in this thesis, and the results will be used to get more knowledge about micro-tasks involving geospatial tasks. 
%The experiment will be administered through a Self-Administered Questionnaire, where the questions will be located in a web-application developed and implemented by the author. When doing questionnaire designed survey, a key factor is to keep the questions short, simple, and clearly worded [\citep{Kitchin2000}, p. 52].

\cite{Gadiraju2015} categorize the top-level crowdsourced tasks, after analyzing platforms as MTurk and CrowdFlower. It resulted in six classes, three relevant classes within geospatial data is \textit{1)Verification and validation}, \textit{2)Interpretation and analysis} and \textit{3)Content creation}. There are examples of all three task classes in geospatial crowdsourcing. During imports of large datasets into OpenStreetMap, crowdsourcing is used to validate the new data. In humanitarian OpenSteetMap, they map areas during a crisis to support the help organizations through crowdsourcing, creating valuable content to the workers in the field (ref xx). In a machine learning process, they are starting to use micro-tasks to both validate the created data and also create data sets to train the algorithms. Shown in chapter \ref{chp:background}. \textit{Interpretation and analysis} tasks rely on the individual to use their interpretation skills during task completion. The experiment conducted in this thesis use \cite{Gadiraju2015} three classes, with emphasis on the \textit{Interpretation and analysis} class, to develop the questions given to the participants. This section will introduce the experiment developed. The experiment generates the data for the analyses, so it is important to implemented and executed the experiment correctly.

%This thesis will try to answer questions regarding micro-tasks containing geospatial data. Is it safe to assume that individuals, both experienced and inexperienced, can interpret and analyze geospatial data presented to them on both map and in tables correctly? Can individuals with little experience in working with geospatial data and map solve geospatial micro-tasks? To the authors best knowledge, little, if any, research has been done on micro-tasks involving map interaction and geospatial interpretation and analysis. 
%Our first sample application asks users to identify which object does not belong in a collection of items. This kind of task requires both image- and semantic-classification capability %http://dbarowy.github.io/AutoMan/

\section{Experiment}\label{sec:experiment}
In general, questionnaires are used to generate quantitative data, which is later used to calculate statistical information [\citep{Kitchin2000}, p. 48]. The experiment is used to generate data and to answer the research hypothesis listes in the introduction. An experiment containing three tasks answering was developed to be able to explain the hypothesis introduced in chapter one. 

The three tasks will vary the number of elements the participant has to use to answer the questions. Each task will contain the same two questions. The questions represent two separate micro-tasks involving geospatial data. The participant will always answer the two questions on six elements, but the tasks vary how many elements to handled at the same time. The variation of the number of elements in the tasks is to hopefully find out if or how much the number of elements in a micro-task effect how well individuals solves the task. 

\subsection{The experiments two micro-tasks}\label{sec:experimentquestions}
The experiment asks two questions, which represents two different geospatial micro-tasks. As mentioned in the introduction in this chapter, the \textit{Interpretation and analysis} task class, listed by \cite{Gadiraju2015}, is emphasized and gives the context to both questions.  The first question asks the participant to click on the color that fits the shape of the marked building(s) on the map best. Question one is an analyzation task. The participant is given two footprint layers covering a building and needs to determine which of the footprints that fit the building shape shown on the base map best. This question is inspired by similar tasks done during large data imports into OpenStreetMap. The import process can not be done fully-automatic and a human task can be to validate which footprint fits the building shape best. Question one displayed on the web application is presented in figure \ref{fig:q12}. In this example, the participants have three buildings to select. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig/q1_2}
	\caption{Question one as it is displayed in the web application}
	\label{fig:q12}
\end{figure}

The second question asks the participant to select the 1/3/6 most informative row(s) that describes random buildings best. Question two is an interpretation task where the participant needs to interpret the information written in the table to decide which row(s) gives the most informative information about an arbitrary building. This is hard for computers do to. What the most informative information is will vary between buildings and what information is present. In figure \ref{fig:q22} question two is displayed in the web application. In this example, the participant has to choose three rows from the table. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig/q2_2}
	\caption{Question two as it is displayed in the web application}
	\label{fig:q22}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experiment tasks}\label{sec:experimenttasks}
The experiment consists of three different tasks, in addition to a training task. When determining the number of elements in the three tasks the author decided to base this on cognitive load theory. Cognitive load theory refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory. Working memory is determined by the number of information elements that need to be processed simultaneously within a certain amount of time \citep{Barrouillet2007}. A heavy cognitive load can have negative effects on task completion. The cognitive load that is imposed by a task is much higher for beginners than for more advanced students \citep{Leppink2014a}.  

The survey will contain three tasks, each task contains six elements, but the task varies how many elements the participant need to answer at the same time. One task will serve the participant with one and one element, demanding the smallest cognitive load. The other task will serve the participant with three and three elements at the same time. This number is just under the limit of how much information humans can process. The last task will serve the participant with all six elements at the same time. This number exceeds the human capacity when processing information according to \cite{Leppink2014a}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{fig/illustration_microtasks}
	\caption{Illustration of the three tasks given in the experiment}
	\label{fig:illustrationmicrotasks}
\end{figure}


It is stated that the working memory has a limited capacity of seven plus or minus two elements (or chunks) of information when merely holding information and even fewer (ca four) when processing information \citep{Leppink2014a}. By choosing three elements in one task and six elements in the other task, this paper can determine if the theories about the limited capacity of the human brain also apply to micro-tasks involving geospatial data. One task will only contain one element as a minimum cognitive load task. The three tasks can help answer how many elements a human can process at the same time without impacting the quality of the result. The goal is to determine a preferred number of elements to include in a micro-task. This information can be useful when developing micro-tasks to achieve adequate task progress as well as accurate results.

The “magical” number of 4 has been demonstrated to limit much of human information processing \citep{Mandler2013}. It is said that polygon comparison demand medium cognitive load \citep{Kiefer2016}, which is what the participants do in the first question in the experiment. \cite{Kiefer2016} argues that high cognitive load may lead to less efficient map reading and spatial orientation, as well as decreased spatial learning. Since polygon comparison demand medium cognitive load, question one should at least not be too demanding on the one- and the three elements task. A worry is that the inexperienced participants will have a bigger struggle than the experienced participants. The extraneous cognitive load imposed high for the inexperienced when solving problems because their lack of prior knowledge of how to solve that type of problem forces them to resort to weak problem-solving strategies \citep{Leppink2014a}. By dividing the participants into experienced and inexperienced categories, the results from the experiment can help determine if geospatial micro-tasks are too demanding on inexperienced individuals. 

\subsection[Building shapes]{Determining the building footprints used in question one}

%Remote sensing is a tool or technique for extracting information about objects or geographic areas. All remote sensing images are subject to some form of geometric distortions. The distortions depend on how the data are obtained \citep{Toutin2004}.  In Norway, most remote sensing images are analysed manually. This is also the case in OpenStreetMap. When using remotely sensed images to create for instance building footprints, it's important to be aware of the distortions in these images. 

According to \cite{Fan2014}, there was over 77 million buildings in the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database in 2013. A study of the geometries of building footprints in the city Munich reveal a huge diversity in the geometries \citep{Fan2014}, and this is probably not the only city with this kind of diversity. The \cite{Fan2014} paper used four criterion's, completeness, semantic accuracy, position accuracy and shape accuracy to evaluate the quality of the building footprints in OSM. In the creation of the two footprints representing the buildings used in question one, the quality criterion's shape- and position accuracy was emphasized. The goal is to create shapes that match realistic cases that occur for instance in OSM. 

%These criteria will be used to create the building elements and conflicts used in the first question in the survey. The first question asks the participant to select the shape that fits the marked building on the map best. The goal is to create shapes that matches realistic cases that occur for instance in OSM. 

%Map matching is the process to identify correspondent features between two geospatial data sets, cannot be used to identify corresponding polygons in two building data sets \citep{Fan2014}.     

Shape accuracy evaluates how well the layer matches the building in an aerial image. \cite{Fan2014} mentions two main reasons to why building footprints are simplified in OSM. The first reason is the difficulties following building details when looking from a bird's eye view. The second reason is the limited resolution of the Bing aerial image used in OSM during digitalization. In question one two footprints is drawn with one of them matching the building shape better than the other. The participant has to use an aerial image to determine which layer fits the building best. This will test if the participants manage to make correct shape judgments by only using an aerial image as a reference.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Creating of footprint layers used in question one}
	\label{fig:building_creation_example}
\end{figure}

Position accuracy evaluates how well the coordinate value of a building relates to the reality on the ground. \cite{Fan2014} tested the accuracy of buildings in OSM and concluded with a mean offset of 4.13 m. The low positional accuracy of OSM building footprints data is caused by the limited resolution of Bing map images. By combining shape- and position accuracy in some of the cases used in question one this study can also determine if participants manage to evaluate both factors. In this study, the participants do not have available information about what the true ground coordinates are. Therefore position accuracy will be examined by shifting one of the layers. The correct positional accuracy will be at the building in the aerial image. 

\section{Web application}
This thesis used an online web-based survey to conduct the experiment. An online survey avoids the cost and effort of printing, distributing, and collecting paper forms. Many people prefer to answer a brief survey displayed on a screen instead of filling in and returning a printed form \citep{Ben2009}. The participants do not have to share the same geographic location as the researcher. 

An online web environment also makes it easier to use interactive maps. An interactive map is necessary to answer question one. It is not possible to have an experiment involving interactive maps on a piece of paper. The web is the obvious way of implementing interactive maps. Making it online, available via URL, makes the distribution faster and easier.

A common web programming language is JavaScript, together with the library React\footnote{React is a open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In React, the displayed data can change without reloading the page. It's main goal is to be fast, simple and scalable.} creates the client side of this thesis application. The client communicates with a server that fetches the task elements from and saves the task results in a PostGIS database. The server is written in Python with the framework Django\footnote{Django is a open-source web framework written in Python. It's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites.}. The PostGIS database contains the task elements, and also the task results gathered from the participants. 
 
\subsection{React application}
The React application was created to serve the experiment to all participants. It contains all the steps of the experiment. First, the participant registers, giving information about age, gender and answers yes or no on the following two questions: 1) "Do you have experience of working with geospatial data?", 2) "Have you heard of micro-tasking before?". Next, the participant is given an introduction page with a detailed introduction video describing how to answer the two questions, on how to interact with the map and building layers. A training task comes after the instruction video, in the training task the participant solves both questions just like the normal tasks, only it contains different building footprints and only two elements in each task to not replicate the other tasks. After the training task, the participant starts with the experiment containing the three tasks, with a short survey after each task. The survey asks the participant to rate the task difficulty between one and five, and if the participant tried his/hers best or was interrupted during the task. The participant can also write a comment. Interfaces for the two questions is shown in figure \ref{fig:q12} and \ref{fig:q22} in section \ref{sec:experimentquestions}. The registration form and survey interface is shown in figure \ref{fig:client-interface}.

\end{figure}
       
Multiple measurements to ensure random and independent observations were implemented during the development of the React application. The main measurements to ensure random, independent observations was:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Random order on the three tasks
	\item Random buildings in the tasks
	\item Random color on the building footprints
	\item Random order on which the building footprints was drawn on the map
	\item Random order on where the information rows was written in the table
\end{itemize}

When distributing an online experiment, the result can be inconsistent since the researcher is not present to either control the participant or the environment surrounding the participant. The researcher implemented functions securing the completeness of the data. The buttons navigating to the next question and task was disabled until enough building footprints or rows were selected. The participant could not submit their task-result before answering both questions correctly. The submit button on the register form and after each task survey only submitted the answers if all fields were answered. If a field missed a message appeared asking the participant to fill out the entire form before submitting. All registered results were complete in the database thanks to these measurements.

\subsection{Data acquisition}
In this study, the independent variables are: 1) experienced or inexperienced participant, 2) number of elements in the task, 3) age and 4) gender of the participant.  Independent variables are factors we think might influence the results of the study [\citep{Kitchin2000}, p. 49]. When a participant registers at the start of the survey the independent variables is generated. Participants who answer yes to the question "Do you have experience of working with geospatial data?" are registered as experienced. The independent variables are believed to influence the dependent variables. Dependent variables are factors the study is interested in explaining [\citep{Kitchin2000}, p. 49]. In this study, the dependent variables are: 1) time spent on each question and task, 2) the number of correctly chosen elements in each question and task, and 3) how difficult the participant though the task was. 

The React application generates and saves the task results. In both questions, the time and number of correct elements are registered. The React application has a timer that registers time elapsed on both questions and adds the time measurements together to get the total time spent on the task. The time only reflects how long the participants spent solving the two questions. Time spent loading new layers, moving to the next question, etc., is not included. Which building footprints and rows the participant selects is also registered, and before saving the result counts the number of correctly chosen elements in each question and then adds the number together to get the total number of correctly chosen elements in the task. A participant can maximum have twelve correct elements, six from each question. Total time and number of correct elements are the two primary dependent variables, and they create the basis of the statistical analyses together with the independent variables mentioned above. Participants task results are saved after each task and contain the following information:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Task number (which task)
	\item Task order number (which order)
	\item Time spent on question one 
	\item Time spent on question two
	\item Total time spent on the task
	\item Correct elements in question one
	\item Correct elements in question two
	\item Total correct elements in the task
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2cm}

After each task the participants answers a short survey. The survey asked the participant about the difficulty of the task, if the participant tried it's best or was interrupted during the task and the participant can also write a comment. This information was used to remove task results where the participants was interrupted. The difficulty question can be used to determine if one of the three tasks is preferred by the participants. 

\section{Pilot test}
Testing the experiment before actual use is highly recommended \citep{Ben2009}. A pilot test provides an opportunity to validate the wording of the tasks. It also helps understand the time necessary for completing the survey, which should be communicated to the participants \citep{Schade2015}. The pilot test was carried out on a small sample of users. Results from the pilot test were in this thesis used to make improvements to the actual survey, to the react application and to find errors or weaknesses in the database models.

After the pilot test, the usability was measured. Usability in this thesis was measured with the \textit{System Usability Scale}(SUS) because it gives a subjective measure of usability. The \textit{System Usability Scale} questionnaire consists of ten statements where the participants rate their agreement on a five-point scale \citep{Ben2009}. Subjective measure of usability is usually obtained through the use of questionnaire and scales \citep{Brooke1996}. SUS was developed to be quick and straightforward, but also reliable enough to be able to compare performance changes between versions \citep{Brooke1996}. It is also easy to administer the participants through the usability test, and it can be used on small sample sizes and still give reliable results \citep{Affairs2013}.  

The usability is important to measure. If the participants do not understand how the web application works, they will probably not do the survey since they then have to invest time in understanding what to do. %they will either exit the survey or answer the questions in the survey wrong. 
It is also important to get enough participants to do the whole survey and not quit halfway in frustration of not understanding it properly. The \textit{System Usability Scale} can effectively differentiate between usable and unusable systems \citep{Affairs2013}. 

\subsection{Execution of the pilot test}
The pilot test was conducted with a total of eight participants, five experienced and three non-experienced participants aged from 22 to 64 years. It started with brief information about this study and the experiment. They were told to talk out load during the test, no help or guidance was given to the participants. The author observed the participants while they conducted the survey. The author took notes and watched if the participants understood the questions and tasks correctly. After the survey a \textit{System Usability Scale} questionnaire was answered by the participants. In the end, the participants were asked to give general feedback on the web application. The SUS score and the feedback were then used to determine the usability of the React application and to determine which improvements to be done.  

\subsection{Results from the pilot test}
The average SUS score was 84.64 out of 100. Anything above 68 is considered above average \citep{Affairs2013}. When adding the SUS score to an adjective rating will an score of 85.5 or higher be described as excellent \citep{Bangor2009}. A score of 84.64 is then described as good/excellent. This result gives a strong indication that the React application is user-friendly. 

All participants thought that the instruction video was confusing. It was short, the instructions went too fast, and it missed voice descriptions. The instructions needed major improvements, an important discovery. The purpose of the video is to give the participant an introduction to how to answer the two questions. It should include important instructions, particularly useful for participants not used to working with interactive maps. 

Overall feedback on question one was that it is hard to understand which building was which because of missing labels, and also to know when a building footprint was selected or not. The lack of labels on the buildings was done on purpose to get the task as much as possible realistic. The process of selecting the best fitting building footprint needed improvements. It had to be clearer that one chosen by clicking on the layer on the map, not by using the layer control as some thought. This part was added to the movie with voice description, describing in detail how a footprint was selected. Improvements to the design of the question one page was made by adding the selected footprint's color to the text telling the participant which layer they had chosen, giving a better visual feedback.

Another feedback from one of the participants was that both question views had too much information and long sentences. The participant advised to shorten the sentences and to move some of the information to the video. 

The test data was used to examine some of the hypothesis to find errors or weaknesses in the database model. The data was extracted from the PostGIS database and saved in CSV files. Some preliminary results can be seen in section \ref{sec:preliminalyresult}. There were a few errors and weaknesses found during the statistical tests. Changes to the database models were necessary, and the implemented changes are listed under: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add foreign key from TaskResult model to TaskSurvey model
	\item Added four other fields in TaskResult model
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Total correct elements 
		\item Task order
		\item Task number
		\item List of correctly chosen building numbers in both questions
	\end{itemize}
	\item The difficulty field in Tasksurvey model was changed from Char field to Integer field
\end{enumerate}

%The additional fields will mainly help with creating plots to better interpret the data and to more easily visualize the different results. 

\subsection{Preliminary results}\label{sec:preliminalyresult}
The pilot-test data was not normally distributed, and doing statistical analysis on data from eight participants didn't seem relevant. The data was mapped in char plots, visualizing some trends. 

The two oldest participants spent almost twice as much time on the test than the younger. Maybe it was too much cognitive load on them. Learning a new application and at the same time understanding how to do the survey and answer the questions given to them. One of them were experienced and the other inexperienced, so this is a surprising result. Figure \ref{fig:allparticipantssortedageparticipantexclude4labelage} show the task results from all participants ordered by age. There are three entries per participant, so three and three bars are results from the same participant. Task 1 represents the task with one elements, task 2 the task with three elements and task 3 the task with six elements.  It is clear to see that the 54 year old participant's total time on task 2 is dramatically higher than the rest.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{fig/allParticipants_sorted_Age_Participant_exclude4_labelage}
	\caption[Total time, all]{Total time - all participants ordered by age}
	\label{fig:allparticipantssortedageparticipantexclude4labelage}
\end{figure}

The average time spent on the survey was 18 minutes. The two oldest participants used on average 33 minutes, while the rest of the participants spent on average 13 minutes to complete the survey. 

In the pilot test, the same building footprints (question one) and information rows (question two) were used in all three tasks. At the end of the pilot test, the author asked the participants if they remembered the buildings and meta information from the previous tasks. $\frac{7}{8}$ answered yes on the question. This information was valuable. If every participant does a better job at the last task, because they remember the elements from earlier tasks, the result will not be as useful. Reading the data in figure \ref{fig:allparticipantssortedageparticipantexclude4labelage}, $\frac{6}{8}$ participants spent less time on the last task, even though the task order varied. This almost matches the number of participants who remembered the previous elements in the last task. This finding made the author create three different task element groups. The three element groups were randomly assigned to each task, to avoid this decision to influence the result. The risk of participants remembering previous task elements disappeared.
%Each element group contained six different buildings with two footprints and meta information covering three separate areas. The groups were designed to contain identical element cases. Eighteen footprint pairs and information row pairs were produced because of this decision.

\section[Sample Size]{Determining the sample size}\label{sec:samplesize}
The sample size is influenced by various factors, including the purpose of the study, population size, the risk of selecting a "bad" sample and the allowable sampling error \citep{Israel1992}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{fig/popsample}
	\caption{Population vs. sample}
	\label{fig:popsample}
\end{figure}

A sample is a collection of observations and is the subset of a population, illustrated in figure \ref{fig:popsample}. The population size in this survey is not easily determined. A population is the collection of individuals of a particular type \citep{Walpole2012}. All individuals with access to a computer and the internet interested in contributing to micro-tasks can be one description of the population. It is important that the sampled population and the target population is similar to one another.

There are three possible ways of determining the sample size in this study. The first option is to use a sample size from a similar study. The risk is to repeat errors that were made in determining the sample for another study. The second option is to rely on published tables, depending on precision, confidence levels, and variability. According to \cite{Israel1992} table 1, an accuracy of 0.05, confidence interval of 95\% and a size of population greater than 100'000, the necessary sample size is 400. If the accuracy is changed to 0.1, the sample size necessary increases to 100 \citep{Israel1992}. The numbers found in the table must reflect the number of obtained responses. The last approach is to use formulas to calculate the sample size. The formulas require the standard deviation and how much variance to expect in the response \citep{Smith2013}\citep{Israel1992}. \cite{Israel1992} mentions that the table gives a useful guide for determining the sample size and that formulas are used if the study has a different combination of precision and confidence. This study will use the table result since the combinations match this study.

It is important to mention that the quality of the sample is as important as the size. The more variable the sampled data is, the larger the sample size is required \citep{Israel1992}. It is also desirable to choose a random sample, which means that the observations are made independently and random. The main purpose of using a random sample is to obtain correct information about the unknown population parameters \citep{Walpole2012}. 


%Results from the pilot-test can be used to determine the sample size. The sample size tells us how many responses that are needed to make inferences about a population as a whole \citep{Smith2013}. The formula for determining the sample size requires the standard deviation, how much variance to expect in the response \citep{Smith2013}. This standard deviation can be calculated from the pilot test results. Determining sample size is a very important issue because samples that are too large may waste time, resources and money, while samples that are too small may lead to inaccurate result. Equation \ref{eq:samplesize} show how to calculate the sample size, n. 

%\begin{equation}\label{eq:samplesize}
%n = [\frac{z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}^2 \sigma (1-\sigma)}{e^2}]
%\end{equation}

%Using the results from all participants, excluding the training task, and using data from the column total time, the standardeviation is 184.8 and mean value 156.1 seconds.
