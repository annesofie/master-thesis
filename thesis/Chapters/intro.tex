\chapter{Introduction}
 %Motivasjonen min for å gjøre dette her 
 Today, information is more available than ever, but having access to information is not the same as learning and understanding the information. Computers have the ability to learn, but it is dependent of training data to learn. Training data is information with contextual meaning. Understanding and giving contextual meaning is what the human brain is good at. The human brain has the ability to create new ideas and concepts \citep{Ross2016}. Therefore, computers needs the human brain to learn, as humans needs computers for their speed and accuracy.  

Albert Einstein illustrates this perfectly: “Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, but stupid. Humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate, but brilliant. Together they may be powerful beyond imagination” \citep{Holzinger2013}. 

This thesis will argue that a good approach for combining the strengths of both computers and humans together is by using micro-tasking. Micro-tasks are the smallest, simplest types of tasks. We believe that micro-tasking has an unexplored potential within geospatial tasks. Geospatial tasks are tasks involving data with geographic position. The tasks can be everything from creating geospatial data to validating or analysing it. 

To the authors best knowledge, little research has been done on micro-tasks involving geospatial data. To be able to exploit the micro-tasking method together with geospatial data, it is important to study how well humans solves these kinds of tasks. Micro-tasks are often published on a micro-tasking platform, where the tasks and people are connected. It is important to know if inexperienced individuals are capable of solving the tasks. If only experienced people can solve geospatial micro-tasks, a platform who can distinguish between people with geospatial knowledge needs to be used. We do not have any knowledge if that kind of platform exists. 

In Remote-Sensing, humans are used to perform land-cover classification tasks \citep{Salk2016}. At least two papers have studied whether there are significant differences in quality in the information contributed by experts and non-experts.
%\cite{Salk2016} looked at how local knowledge and professional background impact the volunteer performance in a land-cover classification tasks. The study used data from an online land-cover classification game where the participants determined if a satellite image or ground photograph contained cropland. The participants could answer 'yes', 'no', or 'maybe'.  
\cite{Salk2016} concluded that there was little first-order relationship between professional background and the task accuracy.
When comparing specialists with non-specialists, the non-specialists performed slightly better on images near home. 
%\cite{See2013} had a similar study. It looked at whether there are significant differences in quality in the information contributed by experts and non-experts. The participants were given pixel outlines of 1 km resolution and were asked to determine the percentage of human impact and the land cover type. 
\cite{See2013} concluded that there was little difference between experts and non-experts, and also found that the non-experts improved more than experts over time. Overall the non-experts were as reliable in what they identified as the experts. These two studies show that the person's background is not necessary important. \cite{See2013} concluded that with proper targeted training material the differences between experts and non-experts can potentially decrease.   
%This thesis aim is to study how well geospatial tasks is solved through micro-tasking. The quality of each completed task when using the micro-task method is important. In this thesis, the quality is measured through the number of correctly chosen elements in each task. The resulting data will distinguish between experienced and inexperienced participants. A micro-task should be small enough so that all individuals can complete the task, independent on their background and experience. 

This thesis aim is to study if micro-tasking can successfully be expanded to involving maps and geospatial data. The OpenStreetMap community has used the method some years, and the usage so far can be evaluated as successful \citep{Erichsen2016}. This thesis will examine if people that do not have experience of working with geospatial data manage to solve geospatial tasks involving a interactive map and also meta data interpretation. The thesis also aims to determine if the number of elements in each micro-task has an impact on how well individuals solves the task. The quality of each completed task, when using the micro-task method, is important. By varying the number of elements present in each micro-task, this thesis can examine if the quality varies between the tasks. 

There is potentially a lot of work creating micro-tasks. The large task needs to be appropriately broken down to micro-tasks that are easy, enjoyable, and fast to solve. This breakdown requires design skills and proper tutorials and examples for new workers \citep{Schulze2012}. 
%Humans make mistakes and these errors need to be detected. Quality mechanisms also needs to be determined, so that the output data is of high quality, without errors. 
To avoid putting too much emphasis on the preparations, guidelines can help to best utilize the preparation resources. The results from this thesis can be used as a guidance on how to break down large geospatial tasks. \\

This thesis will answer the research hypothesis: 
\begin{itemize}
	%\item Is it possible to give micro-tasks containing geospatial data to inexperienced workers?
	\item Inexperienced workers cannot solve micro-tasks containing geospatial data as good as experienced workers
	%\item How many elements should a micro-task containing geospatial data include?
	\item The fewer elements in a micro-task, the better the worker solves the task
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.3cm}
To answer the hypothesis, an online web experiment was developed. The experiment contains three tasks varying the number of elements given to the participant. Each task has the same two questions representing two micro-tasks. One question involves map interaction and the other a interpretation task containing meta information. 

The next chapter will give a thorough introduction to micro-tasking and hopefully make it clearer what this thesis aim is. Then the thesis will introduce the experiment, the web-application hosting the experiment and results from a pilot-test of the experiment. Chapter four will introduce the individuals participating in the experiment, a description of the statistical theory used for the analysis, and give a summary of the gathered data. The last section in chapter four will contain the analyses of the research hypothesis. Chapter five contains the discussion, where the results are summed and discussed. At last the thesis will give a conclusion and proposal for future work.

%A task can traditionally be divided by time, place, person, object, and skill [\citep{Meier2013}, p. 13]. A task can be created by identifying the time it will require, the place where it must be done, the people who need to do the task, the object on which the work is done and finally, the skill needed for the task. Today we have technology that can create and move tasks around based on the four first categories.  Technology can allocate tasks based on the deadline and time the task requires. It can also establish communication between any team of people dependent on which people the task requires. One thing that technology can't do is change the skill of individual workers, though it can only connect people with different skills to work on the same tasks [\citep{Meier2013}, p. 14]. Crowdsourcing moves beyond this and looks at the skills of individual workers, the problem that needs to be solved and combines the best skills of workers to solve the problem. The division of labor by skill has more economic impact than the other four categories [\citep{Meier2013}, p. 15]. Crowdsourcing is a way of refactoring work in a way that exploits the worker's flexibility and gets the right skills to the right part of the problem. To get the right skills to the right part of the problem it needs to be partitioned into smaller parts. Having smaller parts will make it easier to distribute the problem. The distribution can be done through micro-tasking, also called "smart crowdsourcing" by Patrick Meier \citep{Meier2013a}.
