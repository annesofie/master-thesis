Micro-tasking has a  
 
 To the authors best knowledge, little research has been done on micro-tasking geospatial data. This thesis aim is to study how well geospatial data tasks is solved through micro-tasking. The quality of the completed tasks when doing micro-tasks it is important. In this study the quality is measured through the number of correctly chosen elements in each task. The resulting data will distinguish between experienced and inexperienced participants. A micro-task should be small enough so that all individuals can complete the task, independent on their background and experience. 
 
 \cite{Salk2016} looked at how local knowledge and professional background, impact the volunteer performance in a land-cover classification tasks. The study used data from an online land-cover classification game where the participants determined if a satellite image or ground photograph contained cropland. The participants could answer 'yes', 'no', or 'maybe'.  \cite{Salk2016} concluded that there was no difference in how well the participants did, and their background.%*Dobbeltsjekk siste setning
  There was a small difference in classification accuracy when the participant classified areas in their home country. When comparing specialists with non-specialists, the non-specialists performed slightly better on images near home.

A task can traditionally be divided by time, place, person, object, and skill [\citep{Meier2013}, p. 13]. A task can be created by identifying the time it will require, the place where it must be done, the people who need to do the task, the object on which the work is done and finally, the skill needed for the task. Today we have technology that can create and move tasks around based on the four first categories.  Technology can allocate tasks based on the deadline and time the task requires. It can also establish communication between any team of people dependent on which people the task requires. One thing that technology can't do is change the skill of individual workers, though it can only connect people with different skills to work on the same tasks [\citep{Meier2013}, p. 14]. Crowdsourcing moves beyond this and looks at the skills of individual workers, the problem that needs to be solved and combines the best skills of workers to solve the problem. The division of labor by skill has more economic impact than the other four categories [\citep{Meier2013}, p. 15]. Crowdsourcing is a way of refactoring work in a way that exploits the worker's flexibility and gets the right skills to the right part of the problem. To get the right skills to the right part of the problem it needs to be partitioned into smaller parts. Having smaller parts will make it easier to distribute the problem. The distribution can be done through micro-tasking, also called "smart crowdsourcing" by Patrick Meier \citep{Meier2013a}. 

This thesis aim is to study if micro-tasking can successfully be expanded to involving maps and geospatial data. The OpenStreetMap community has used the method some time, and the usage so far can be evaluated as successful. %*Referer til prosjektoppgave 
This thesis also aims to find out if inexperienced individuals also manage to solve tasks on maps that involves geospatial data. The study also aims to determine if the number of elements in each micro-task has an impact on how well individuals solve the micro-tasks. The quality of the work, the number of correctly solved tasks and time, is measured. The thesis uses a survey hosted through a web-application to gather participant data. The data is then used to answer this thesis hypothesizes. The next chapter will give a thorough introduction to micro-tasking and hopefully make it clearer what this thesis aim is. Chapter 3 will explain the survey and chapter 4 will contain the statistics, both hypothesis, theory, and results. 



Albert Einstein illustrates this perfectly: “Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, but stupid. Humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate, but brilliant. Together they may be powerful beyond imagination” \citep{Holzinger2013}. 

This thesis will try to answer the research hypothesis: 
\begin{itemize}
	%\item Is it possible to give micro-tasks containing geospatial data to inexperienced workers?
	\item Inexperienced workers cannot solve micro-tasks containing geospatial data as good as experienced workers
	%\item How many elements should a micro-task containing geospatial data include?
	\item The fewer elements in a micro-task, the better the worker solves the task
\end{itemize}

To answer the hypothesis, the author created an online web experiment. The experiment contains three tasks varying the number of elements given to the participant. Each task has the same two questions representing two micro-tasks. One question involves map interaction and the other a interpretation task containing meta information. 

 First this thesis will present a background chapter about micro-tasking.  Then the thesis will introduce the experiment, the application serving the experiment and results from a pilot-test of the experiment. Chapter four will introduce the gathered data, who were the participants, and introduce statistical theory used for the analysis. The last section in chapter four will contain analyses of the research hypothesis.
