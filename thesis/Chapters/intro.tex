Doing fully automated operations on geospatial data can be proven difficult to accomplish. 

This thesis aim is to study if micro-tasks can successfully be expanded to involving maps and geospatial data. The OpenStreetMap community have used the method some time, and the usage so far can evaluate as successful. This thesis wants to find out if inexperienced individuals also manage to solve tasks on maps that involved geospatial data. The study also wants to determine if the number of elements in each micro-task has an impact on how well individuals solve the microtasks. Both number of correctly chosen elements and time is measured. The thesis used a survey hosted through an web-application to gather participant data. The data is then used in statistics methods. The methods will then accept or deny the null hypothesis.
