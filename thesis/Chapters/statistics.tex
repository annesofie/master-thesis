Can use it to explain the data

\subsection{Gathered data}\label{sec:gathereddata}

The gathered data will be analyzed on the two dependent variables: 1) total time used to complete each task and 2) number of correctly chosen elements per task. Total time and the number of correct elements sums the time and correctly chosen elements on question one and question two. Sample mean $\overline{x}$, sample median, standard deviation of $\overline{x}$, standard error ($\frac{standard deviation}{\sqrt{sample size}}$) of $\overline{x}$, minimum in sample and maximum in sample are listed in the tabled in this section. The sample number is also written in the tables. These numbers are used in the analysis of the data, to easier understand which sample is used in the different analysis. In all samples, results from the training task are removed. Only results from the three tasks are used. Results from participants that was disturbed during the survey were also removed, four of the participants spent more than twice the estimated time on the survey. Maximum possible correct elements per task are twelve. There are six elements in question one and six elements in question two, and the number of correctly chosen elements in each task is added together maximum twelve correctly chosen elements.

% The tables in this section, (\ref{sec:gathereddata}), are task results from all participants and all three tasks, excluding the training task. Task results with total time longer than 2160 seconds are filtered out. This is to remove 4 outliers that spend more than twice the approximated time (average time on the survey was 1080 seconds in the pilot test). These 4 participants also answered that they were disturbed during the test.

 The gathered data are in the first subsection (\ref{sec:alltasks}) divided into experienced and inexperienced. In subsection \ref{sec:taskdivided_all} the data is divided into the three tasks, containing all participants. Section \ref{sec:taskdivided_experienced}  and \ref{sec:taskdivided_inexperienced} divides the data into the three tasks and also in experienced and inexperienced participants. 
 
%Removed all participants that said they was distracted. 26 task results was removed, 10 inexperienced and 18 experienced results.

\subsubsection{All,  experienced and inexperienced participants}\label{sec:alltasks}

Table \ref{tab:totaltime_all} and \ref{tab:totalcorrect_all} are samples containing task results from all, experienced and inexperienced participants. The result is divided into the two dependent variables, total time and the number of correctly chosen elements.

\subsection{Normality tests}\label{sec:normality_results}
To check if a two-sample t-test (subsection \ref{sec:t-test}) and \textit{ANOVA}-test (subsection \ref{sec:anova}) can be used, the samples need to be tested if they are normally distributed or not. Both tests assume normally distributed samples. The normality section \ref{sec:normaltesting} concluded that the D'Agostino and Person normality test should be used in this thesis. A visual interpretation of histograms will also be a part of the normality tests. The D'Agostino-Pearson test uses the following hypothesis:\newline

\centerline{$H_{0}$: The data follows the normal distribution} 
\centerline{$H_{A}$: The data do not follow the normal distribution}


\subsubsection[Sample 1 and 2]{Experienced and inexperienced participants - total time samples}\label{sec:totaltime_ex_inex}
This section will test if sample 1 and 2 (table \ref{tab:totaltime_all}) are normally distributed. Sample 1 and 2 will be used to test if there are any difference on time spent per task between experienced and inexperienced participants. 

A visual interpretation of the histograms \ref{fig:totaltimeexclude4_experienced} and \ref{fig:totaltimeexclude4_inexperienced} gives an indication that sample 1 and 2 are not normally distributed. Both histograms are positively skewed (figure \ref{fig:skew}). Samples involving time measurements are rarely normally distributed. This is because the samples will always be skewed since it is impossible to have negative time and there will always be a limit to how fast a participant can finish the task.

	\end{subfigure}
\caption{Histograms with normal distribution fit with samples containing total time to complete each task}
\end{figure}

A D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirmed the visual interpretation with an significance level of 5\% (0.05). Both samples have p-values lower than the significance level. They are not normally distributed with a confidence level of 95\%. \\[0.5cm]

%Boc-Cox Transformation? https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/normality/dealing-non-normal-data-strategies-and-tools/

In both sample 1 and 2, the p-value was significantly lower than the significance level of 0.05. Data transformations are commonly used tools to improve normality of a sample's distributions, but there are many types of data transformations. \cite{Osborne2010} claim that almost all tests, even non-parametric tests, benefit from improving the normality of the samples, especially when the normality test is significantly denied. Common traditional transformations are square root, inverse or converting to logarithmic scales  \citep{Osborne2010}. 

A Box-Cox power transformation is used in this thesis. This transformation can be used on positive data and the data used in this thesis will never negative. Box-Cox takes the idea of having a range of power transformations (square root $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$, inverse $x^{-1}$ etc.) available to improve the effectiveness of normalizing and variance equalizing for both positively- and negatively-skewed variables \citep{Osborne2010}. This transformation will always use the appropriate transformation to be maximally effective in moving each sampled data towards normality. This is the reason why this thesis will use the Box-Cox transformation.

Sample 1 and 2 after Box-Cox transformation is shown in histogram \ref{fig:totaltimeboxcoxtransformation_experienced} and \ref{fig:totaltimeboxcoxtransformedtitle_inexperienced}. A visual inspection gives a good indication that the transformed data is normally distributed.

	\end{subfigure}
\caption{Histograms with normal distribution fit after Box-Cox transformation}
\end{figure}

The D'Agostino and Pearson normality method is then tested on the transformed data. This test confirms the visual analysis, both sample 1 and sample 2 are normally distributed after the Box-Cox transformation with a confidence level of 95\%. The calculated p-value is larger than the significance level (0.05). \\[0.5cm]

\end{center}

The assumption that sample 1 and sample 2 are normally distributed is now accepted and can be used in parametric methods when using these samples.

\subsubsection[Sample 3 and 4]{Experienced and inexperienced participants - number of correctly chosen elements samples}\label{sec:correct_ex_inex}
%DIscrete variables http://stattrek.com/probability-distributions/discrete-continuous.aspx
This section will test if sample 3 and 4 (table \ref{tab:totalcorrect_all}) are normally distributed. Sample 3 and 4 will be used to test if there are any difference on the number of correct elements per task between experienced and inexperienced participants. 

A visual inspection of the samples histogram \ref{fig:correctelementswasnotinterupter_ex} and \ref{fig:correctelementswasnotinterupted_inex} gives a good indication that sample 3 and 4 are not normally distributed. Both are negatively skewed (figure \ref{fig:skew}).

D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirm our visual analysis. Both samples accept the alternative hypothesis with p-values lower than the significant level $0.05$. \\[0.3cm]

	\end{tcolorbox} 
\end{center}

\vspace{0.3cm}

Sample 3 and 4 was then Box-Cox transformed. After the transformation, a new D'Agostino and Pearson normality test was done. Both samples also failed this test. Sample 3 and 4 are not normally distributed and need to be tested with non-parametric methods. 

\subsubsection[Sample 5, 6 and 7]{All participants - Task 1, Task 2 and Task 3 - total time per task}\label{sec:task123_time_normaltest}

In this section sample 5, 6 and 7 (table \ref{tab:totaltime_tasks}) is normality tested. These samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference between the three tasks when looking at the total time variable. 

A visual analysis of the three histograms in figure \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinterupted_task1}, \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinterupted_task2} and \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinterupted_task3} show a positive skewness, just like the time histograms in section \ref{sec:totaltime_ex_inex}. This gives an indication that the three samples are not normally distributed.

The D'Agostino and Pearson normality test agreed with the visual analysis. P-values for all samples are smaller than the significance level 0.05, and the null hypothesis is rejected. The samples are not normally distributed with a confidence level of 95\%.\\[0.2cm]

The samples are then Box-Cox transformed. Histograms of each sample after the transformation is shown in figure \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinteruptedboxcox_task1}, \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinteruptedboxcox_task2} and \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinteruptedboxcox_task3}. A visual analysis of the histograms gives a good indication that the transformed data is approximately normally distributed. The histograms have a skewness of approximately zero.

The D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirms the visual interpretation. The data is normally distributed after the Box-Cox transformation with a confidence interval of 95\%. The p-values of all three samples are higher than the significance level (0.05). \\[0.2cm]

 Sample 5, 6 and 7 are normally distributed after the transformation and the assumptions of normality is met. 
 
 \subsubsection[Sample 8, 9 and 10]{All participants - Task 1, Task 2 and Task 3 - correct elements per task}\label{sec:task123_correct_normaltest}
 In this section sample 8, 9 and 10 will be normality tested. These samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference between the three tasks when looking at the number of correctly chosen elements variable. This variable tells us how many correct elements each participant chose on each of the three tasks. 

A visual analysis of the three histograms in figure \ref{fig:correctallnotinterupted_task1}, \ref{fig:correctallnotinterupted_task2} and \ref{fig:correctallnotinterupted_task3} show a negative skewness, just like the histograms in section \ref{sec:correct_ex_inex}. This give an indication that the three samples are not normally distributed.

 D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirms our visual analysis of the histograms in two of three samples. Sample 9 actually passes the normality test, even though the p-value (0.099) is close to the significance level (0.05). Sample 8 and sample 10 do not pass the normality test with a confidence interval of 95\%. \\[0.2cm]

A Box-Cox transformation is applied to all three samples. The transformation changes the data, and to correctly compare the samples, sample 9 also has to be transformed even though it's original data is normally distributed. The transformed samples are shown in histogram \ref{fig:correctboxcox_task1}, \ref{fig:correctboxcox_task2} and \ref{fig:correctboxcox_task3}. All three are negatively skewed, sample 9 and 10 less than sample 8. A visual conclusion is difficult in this case. \\[0.2cm]

When using these three samples in hypothesis tests a non-parametric method should be used. This is because sample 8 is not normally distributed. 

\subsubsection[Sample 11, 12 and 13]{Experienced participants - task 1, 2 and 3, total time variable}
In this section sample 11, 12 and 13 are normality tested. These samples will be used to test whether there is s significant difference between the three tasks total time results when looking at only experienced participants. 

A visual interpretation of the histograms in \ref{fig:sample11_12_13_histogram} show that all three samples are positively skewed (figure \ref{fig:skew}). This is a fairly strong evidence that the samples are not normally distributed.

The Box-Cox transformed data is tested with D'Agostino and Pearson normality test. All three samples have a p-value larger than the significance level (0.05). Within a confidence interval of 95\%, the test concludes that sample 11, 12 and 13 is normally distributed.\\[0.2cm]

Sample 11, 12 and 13 can be used in methods assuming normally distributed samples. 

\subsubsection[Sample 14, 15 and 16]{Experienced participants - task 1, 2, 3, correct elements variable}
This section will test if sample 14, 15 and 16 follows the normal distribution. These samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference in the number of correct elements results between the three tasks when looking at only experienced participants. Before testing the hypothesis the samples need to be normality tested. 

A visual interpretation of the histograms in \ref{fig:sample14,15,16_normhistogram} show that all three samples are slightly negatively skewed (figure \ref{fig:skew}). The skew is not as much as other histograms in this chapter. Sample 15 (\ref{fig:correctexperienced_task1}) and sample 16 (\ref{fig:correctexperienced_task2}) has less skew than sample 14 (\ref{fig:correctexperienced_task3}).

This section will test if sample 17, 18 and 19 follows the normal distribution. These samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference in the total time results between the three tasks when looking at only inexperienced participants. Before testing the hypothesis the samples need to be normality tested.

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:normaltesting} and \ref{sec:anova}, the two sample t-test and \textit{ANOVA} assumes that the samples come from a population with equal variances. This assumption will be examined with Levene's test. The hypothesis in this test is: \\[0.5cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: Input samples are from populations with equal variances} 
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Input samples are from populations that do not have equal variances}

\subsubsection[Sample 1 and 2]{Sample 1 and 2}\label{sec:sample1,2_levene}
Since sample 1 and 2 was normal distributed accepted after the Box-Cox transformation, will the Levene's test use the transformed data in the analysis. Both samples contain total time spent on each task where sample 1 is for experienced and sample 2 is for inexperienced participants. The results is shown in the box under. Levene's test rejects the null hypothesis with a confidence interval of 95\%. \\[0.2cm]

\subsection{Hypothesis testing}\label{sec:hypothesis_results}

\subsubsection[Sample 1, 2]{Test differences in total time between experienced and inexperienced participants}\label{sec:t-test_result} %Two sample t-test results

%\textbf{Test differences between experienced and inexperienced participants}\\
\textit{Sample 1 and 2}\newline

The hypothesis tested in this section is: \\[0.3cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: Equal total task time between experienced and inexperienced participants} 
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Unequal task time between experienced and inexperienced participants}

\vspace{0.3cm}

This test is covered by sample 1 and sample 2 from section \ref{sec:totaltime_ex_inex}. Sample 1 is experienced participants and sample 2 inexperienced participants. Both samples was normally distributed after a Box-Cox transformation, so a two sample t-test will be used to answer this hypothesis. $\overline{x}_1$ equals the mean total time for experienced-, and $\overline{x}_2$ the mean total time for inexperienced participants, the hypothesis can be written as:\\[0.3cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_1$ = $\overline{x}_2$} 
\centerline{$H_{A}$: $\overline{x}_1$ $\neq$ $\overline{x}_2$}

\vspace{0.3cm}

Since we cannot assume equal variances in the two samples (\ref{sec:sample1,2_levenes}), this test will use the Welch's t-test for unequal variances [\citep{Walpole2012}, p. 345]. Equation \ref{eq:ttest_twoway} is still valid. Results are shown under. The T-statistic calculated is smaller than the critical value. The t-test conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two population samples with a confidence interval of 95\%.\\[0.2cm]

 \begin{center}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[width=0.8\textwidth]

		Significance level ($\alpha$): 0.05 \\
		Critical value: 1.960\\[0.2cm]
		
		Using equation \ref{eq:ttest_twoway}, the absolute value of the $T-statistic$ is larger than the critical value ($|60.442|$ > $1.960$) and the null hypothesis is \underline{rejected} and $H_A$ accepted.\\[0.5cm]

	\end{tcolorbox} 
\end{center}

\vspace{0.7cm}

\textbf{Test if experienced or inexperienced participants finish the task fastest} 

The second hypothesis tested in this section is:\newline

%\centerline{$H_{0}$: Inexperienced participants has a lower or equal total time compared to experienced participants.}
\centerline{$H_{0}$: Equal total task time between all participants}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Experience participants has a lower total time}

With sample 1 equals experienced participants and sample 2 equals inexperienced participants we get the hypothesis:\\[0.2cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_1$ = $\overline{x}_2$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: $\overline{x}_1$ < $\overline{x}_2$}

This test gives the same T-statistics as the previous test, but the critical value is changed since the test is changed to a two sample, one-way t-test. Since we cannot assume equal variances in the two samples a Welch's test is performed. The test results are shown under. The $T-statistic$ is still smaller than the critical value (-64.654 < 1.645). Our test is to check if sample 1's mean is significantly larger than sample 2's mean, then we use the test written in equation \ref{eq:ttest_greater}. Our $T-statistic$ is not larger than the critical value, therefore we need to accept the null hypothesis. There is no evidence that experienced participants use less time on the tasks than the inexperienced. \\[0.2cm]

	\label{fig:meanstdparticipantstime}
\end{figure}

Since we know that there is a significant difference between the two sample means, the author concludes that the inexperienced participants finished the task faster than the experienced participants. This can also be seen in plot \ref{fig:meanstdparticipantstime}. Inexperienced participants finished the tasks 16 seconds faster than experienced participants. \newline

\subsubsection[Sample 3, 4]{Test if there is a difference between experienced and inexperienced participants in total correct elements} %Mann-Whitey U Test results
%\textbf{Test differences between experienced and inexperienced participants}\\
\textit{Sample 3 and 4}\newline

This section will test if there is a difference between experienced- and inexperienced participants when looking at the number of correctly chosen elements. Sample 3 and 4 is the correct samples to use in this test. Both samples are not normally distributed, we need to use a non-parametric method. The Mann-Whitey U test is the preferred test to use on these samples. As mentioned in section \ref{sec:Wilcoxon}, the Mann-Whitey U test is preferred when the samples have ties (identical observations) in the data. From histogram \ref{fig:correctelementswasnotinterupter_ex} and \ref{fig:correctelementswasnotinterupted_inex} we see that the samples for both independent variables are similar. Mann-Whitey U test can therefore be used to compare the population medians. The hypothesis to be tested is:\\[0.3cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $median_3$ = $median_4$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: $median_3$ $\neq$ $median_4$}

The results of the test, the statistical value and finding the critical value in the Mann-Whitey U table is shown in the box under. Using equation \ref{eq:mannwhitey-ciritcalvalue} we conclude that there are not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis with a confidence interval of 95\%. The $U-statistic$ is larger than the critical value.

There is not enough evidence to conclude that there is any difference between experienced- and inexperienced participants when looking at the number of correctly chosen elements per task. 

\subsubsection[Sample 5, 6 and 7]{Test if total time differs between the three tasks}\label{sec:anova_result} %One-way \textit{ANOVA} test results
\textit{Sample 5, 6 and 7}\newline

This section will test if there is a difference in total time between the three tasks in this survey. Sample 5, 6, and 7 is the samples to use in this test. The one-way \textit{ANOVA} test will be used in this section. This test is used when there are more than two samples being compared (section \ref{sec:anova}). The assumption that sample 5, 6 and 7 come from populations with equal variances are met \ref{sec:sample5,6,7}), the samples are also normally distributed after a Box-Cox transformation (\ref{sec:task123_time_normaltest}). The hypothesis tested here is:\\

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_5$ = $\overline{x}_6$ = $\overline{x}_7$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Total time is different between at least two of the tasks}

Using equation \ref{eq:anova_reject} and results shown in the box under, the \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis. The $f-value$ is lower than the critical value. With a confidence interval of 95\% the author claim that there is a difference between the mean value of the three tasks.

Since the null hypothesis was rejected \textit{Tukey's method} will be used to make compared comparisons between task one, two and three. This test did not find any significant difference between the three tasks. The author then concludes that there is a difference in total time between the three tasks, but the difference is not enough that \textit{Tukey's test} find a significant difference.

\textit{Sample 8, 9, and 10}\newline

This section will test if there is a difference in the number of correctly chosen elements between the three survey tests. The test will use sample 8, 9 and 10. Since sample 8 are not normally distributed (\ref{sec:task123_correct_normaltest}) a non-parametric test should be used. The Kruskal-Wallis test is the non-parametric eqvivalent to one-way \textit{ANOVA} (\ref{sec:kruskal-w-test}). It is used to test equality of medians when the samples are not normally distributed. This method will test if there is any difference between task 1, 2 and 3 when looking at the dependent variable number of correctly chosen elements. The hypothesis tested is: \\[0.2cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $median_8$ = $median_9$ = $median_10$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Number of correctly chosen elements is different between at least two of the tasks}

Using equation \ref{eq:kruskapw-accept}, the Kruskal-Wallis test rejects the null hypothesis. $H-value$ is smaller than the critical value found. P-value is approximately zero and this gives a good indication that the result is significant. With a confidence interval of 95\% the author claim that there is a difference between the median value of the three tasks. \\[0.2cm]

Like in one-way \textit{ANOVA}, a \textit{post hoc} test should be used to make paired comparisons to determine which groups differ. The \textit{post hoc} test used in this section is Tukey's test. Results from Tukey's test resulted in a significant difference in the number of correctly chosen elements between task 1 and task 2, and task 1 and task 3. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdtask123pngcorrect} show that task 1 has a higher mean value than the other two tasks. Task 1 also has a smaller standard deviation than the other tasks. \\[0.2cm]

The results in this section find significant evidence that experienced participants had a higher number of correct elements in task 1 than in the other tasks. 

\subsubsection[Sample 11, 12 and 13]{Test differenced in results from experienced participants between task 1, 2 and 3}\label{sec:sample_11_12_13_anova}
This section will answer two hypothesis about experienced participant's results divided in task 1, 2 and 3. Sample 11, 12 and 13 will be used on the first hypothesis. The three samples are normally distributed after a Box-Cox transformation (\ref{tab:normaltest_summary}) and the samples also come from populations with equal variances (\ref{sec:sample11,12,13_levene}). Sample 14, 15 and 16 will be used on the second hypothesis. All three samples are normally distributed (\ref{tab:normaltest_summary}) and the samples also come from populations with equal variances (\ref{sec:sample14,15,16_levene}). The one-way \textit{ANOVA} will be used to test both hypotheses. The first hypothesis will test if time spent on each task differ when including only results from experienced participants and the second hypothesis will test if the number of correct elements in each task differs when including only results from experienced participants. 

The first hypothesis is:\\
\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_{11}$ = $\overline{x}_{12}$ = $\overline{x}_{13}$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Total time is different between at least two of the tasks}

Using equation \ref{eq:anova_reject}, the one-way \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis. The $f-value$ calculated ($1216.919$) is higher than the critical value ($3.00$) on all three samples. P-value is also approximately zero and gives a good indication that the result is significant. With a confidence interval of 95\% the author claim that there is a time difference between the three tasks. When the null hypothesis is rejected a \textit{post hoc} test is used to compare each task with each other. Tukey's test did not find any significant difference between the three tasks with a significant level of 5\%. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123time} show an approximately similar mean in all three tasks, task 2 has a lower mean and less standard deviation. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../../thesis-statisticmethods/statistic_analysis/figures/boxplot/mean_std_experienced_task123_time}
	\caption{Sample 11, 12 and 13 - mean (green dot) and standard deviation (blue line)}
	\label{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123time}
\end{figure}

The author concludes that there is a significant difference when looking at experienced participants time spent on the three tasks, but the difference is not enough so that \textit{Tukey's test} find which tasks that differ. \newline

The second hypothesis is:\\
\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_11$ = $\overline{x}_12$ = $\overline{x}_13$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Correct elements in each task is different between at least two of the tasks}

Using equation \ref{eq:anova_reject}, the \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis. The $f-value$ calculated ($8.210$) is higher than the critical value ($3.00$). P-value is also approximately zero and gives a good indication that the result is significant. With a confidence interval of 95\% the author claim that there is a difference between the mean value of the three tasks. Since the null hypothesis was rejected, a \textit{post hoc} test should be used to make paired comparisons to determine which groups differ. Tukey's test resulted in a significant difference in the number of correctly chosen elements between task 1 and task 2, and task 1 and task 3. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123correct} show that task 1 has a higher mean value than the two other tasks. Task 1 also has a smaller standard deviation.

\vspace{0.3cm}

With the results found in this section the author concludes that there is a significant difference in the number of correctly chosen elements between the three tasks. The experienced participants got the best result in task 1. 

\subsubsection[Sample 17, 18 and 19, 20, 21 and 22]{Test differenced for both variables, inexperienced participants between task 1, 2 and 3}\label{sec:sample_17_18_19_anova}

This section will answer the same hypothesis at the two previous sections, only with results from inexperienced participants. Sample 17, 18 and 19 will be used on the first hypothesis. The samples are normally distributed (\ref{sec:sample_17,18,19_normalitytest}) and come from populations with equal variances (\ref{sec:sample17,18,19_levene}). Sample 20, 21 and 22 will be used on the second hypothesis. All three samples are normally distributed (\ref{sec:sample_20,21,22_normalitytest}) and also come from populations with equal variances (\ref{sec:sample20,21,22_levene}). The one-way \textit{ANOVA} will be used to test both hypotheses. The first hypothesis will test if time spent on each task differ when including only results from inexperienced participants and the second hypothesis will test if the number of correct elements in each task differs when including only results from inexperienced participants. 

The first hypothesis is:\\
\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_{17}$ = $\overline{x}_{18}$ = $\overline{x}_{19}$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Total time is different between at least two of the tasks}

The one-way \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis and accepts the alternative hypothesis ($H_{A}$) with a significant level of 5\%. Tukey's \textit{post hoc} test is used to make compared comparisons between task 1, task 2 and task 3. The test doesn't find a significant difference when comparing each of the three tasks with a significant level of 5\%. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123time} show that inexperienced participants spent more time on task 2 than the other tasks, but the difference is not significant according to Tukey's test.

\centerline{$H_{A}$: Number of correct elements is different between at least two of the tasks}

The one-way \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and accepts the alternative hypothesis ($H_{A}$) with a significance level of 5\%. Since the null hypothesis was rejected Tukey's \textit{post hoc} test will be used to make comparisons between the three tasks. This test cannot find a significant difference when comparing the tasks with a significant level of 5\%. Looking at figure \ref{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123correct}, task 1 has a higher mean than the two other tasks, also task 2 has a higher mean than task 3. Even though there are differences in the number of correct elements between the tasks, it is not significant according to Tukey's test.
