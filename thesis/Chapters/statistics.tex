\subsection{Gathered data}\label{sec:gathereddata}
The gathered data is analyzed on the two dependent variables: 1) total time used to complete each task and 2) number of correctly chosen elements per task. Both variables sum the participants time spent and correct elements on question one and question two together. The gathered data is also divided by the two independent variable pairs: 1) experienced- and inexperienced participants and 2) the three survey tasks. Combining the dependent- and independent variables create the foundation of the 22 different samples in this thesis. The samples are listed in the tables in this section. Sample mean $\overline{x}$, sample median, standard deviation of $\overline{x}$, standard error ($\frac{standard deviation}{\sqrt{sample size}}$) of $\overline{x}$, minimum in sample and maximum in sample is listed in the tables. The sample number is also written in the tables and is used in the analysis of the data, to easier distinguish which sample is used in the different analyses. In all the samples, results from the training task and from participants that were disturbed during the survey is removed.
% The tables in this section, (\ref{sec:gathereddata}), are task results from all participants and all three tasks, excluding the training task. Task results with a total time longer than 2160 seconds are filtered out. This is to remove four outliers that spend more than twice the approximated time (average time on the survey was 1080 seconds in the pilot test). These 4 participants also answered that they were disturbed during the test.

The gathered data are in the first subsection (\ref{sec:alltasks}) divided into experienced and inexperienced. In subsection \ref{sec:taskdivided_all} the data is divided by the three tasks, containing all participants. Section \ref{sec:taskdivided_experienced}  and \ref{sec:taskdivided_inexperienced} divides the data by the three tasks and also in experienced and inexperienced participants. 

%Removed all participants that said they was distracted. 26 task results was removed, 10 inexperienced and 18 experienced results.

\subsubsection{All,  experienced and inexperienced participants}\label{sec:alltasks}

Table \ref{tab:totaltime_all} and \ref{tab:totalcorrect_all} are samples containing task results from all, experienced and inexperienced participants. The result is divided into the two dependent variables, total time and the number of correctly chosen elements.

\subsection{Normality tests}\label{sec:normality_results}
%To check if a two-sample t-test (subsection \ref{sec:t-test}) and \textit{ANOVA}-test (subsection \ref{sec:anova}) can be used, the samples need to be tested if they are normally distributed or not. Both tests assume normally distributed samples. 
The samples need to be tested if they follow a normal distribution. This test is important for determining if a parametric or a non-parametric test should be used when including the different samples in the hypothesis tests. The section about normal testing (\ref{sec:normaltesting}) concluded that the D'Agostino and Person normality test should be used in this thesis. A visual interpretation of histograms will also be a part of the normality test. D'Agostino-Pearson uses the following hypothesis:\newline

\centerline{$H_{0}$: The data follows the normal distribution} 
\centerline{$H_{A}$: The data do not follow the normal distribution}


\subsubsection[Sample 1 and 2]{Experienced and inexperienced participants, total time variable}\label{sec:sample1,2_normresult}
This section will test if sample 1 and 2 (table \ref{tab:totaltime_all}) follow a normal distribution. Sample 1 and 2 will be used to determine if there are a significant difference in time spent on the tasks between experienced and inexperienced participants. 

A visual interpretation of histogram \ref{fig:totaltimeexclude4_experienced} and \ref{fig:totaltimeexclude4_inexperienced} gives an indication that sample 1 and 2 are not normally distributed. Both histograms are positively skewed (figure \ref{fig:skew}). Samples involving time measurements are rarely normally distributed. This is because the samples will always be skewed since it is impossible to have negative time and there will always be a limit to how fast a participant can finish the task.

\caption{Histograms with normal distribution fit with samples containing total time to complete each task}
\label{fig:sample1,2_histo_original}
\end{figure}

A D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirmed the visual interpretation with a significance level of 5\%. Both samples obtained p-values lower than the significance level, and the null hypothesis is rejected. Sample 1 and 2 are not normally distributed with a confidence level of 95\%. \\[0.5cm]

%Boc-Cox Transformation? https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/normality/dealing-non-normal-data-strategies-and-tools/
In both sample 1 and 2, the p-value was significantly lower than the significance level of 5\%. Data transformations are commonly used tools to improve normality of a sample's distributions, but there are many types of data transformations. \cite{Osborne2010} claim that almost all tests, even non-parametric tests, benefit from improving the normality of the samples, especially when the normality test is significantly denied. Typical traditional transformations are square root, inverse or converting to logarithmic scales  \citep{Osborne2010}. 

A Box-Cox power transformation (Box-Cox) is used in this thesis. This transformation can only be used on positive data and the data gathered in this thesis will never be below zero. Box-Cox takes the idea of having a range of power transformations (square root $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$, inverse $x^{-1}$, etc.) available to improve the effectiveness of normalizing and variance equalizing for both positively- and negatively-skewed variables \citep{Osborne2010}. This transformation will always use the appropriate conversion to be maximally effective in moving each sampled data towards normality. This is the reason why this thesis will use the Box-Cox transformation.

Sample 1 and 2 after a Box-Cox is shown in histogram \ref{fig:totaltimeboxcoxtransformation_experienced} and \ref{fig:totaltimeboxcoxtransformedtitle_inexperienced}. A visual inspection gives a good indication that the transformed data is normally distributed. The skewness looks approximately zero.

	\end{subfigure}
\caption{Histograms with normal distribution fit after Box-Cox power transformation}
\end{figure}

The transformed data is then applied to the D'Agostino and Pearson test. This test confirms the visual analysis, both sample 1 and sample 2 are normally distributed after the Box-Cox with a confidence level of 95\%. The calculated p-value is larger than the significance level of 5\%. \\[0.5cm]

\end{center}

The assumption that sample 1 and sample 2 are normally distributed is now accepted and the transformed data can be used in parametric methods.

\subsubsection[Sample 3 and 4]{Experienced and inexperienced participants, number of correctly chosen elements variable}\label{sec:correct_ex_inex}
%DIscrete variables http://stattrek.com/probability-distributions/discrete-continuous.aspx
This section will test if sample 3 and 4 (table \ref{tab:totalcorrect_all}) are normally distributed. Sample 3 and 4 will be used to test if there are any difference in the number of correctly chosen elements per task between experienced and inexperienced participants. 

A visual inspection of the samples histogram \ref{fig:correctelementswasnotinterupter_ex} and \ref{fig:correctelementswasnotinterupted_inex} gives a good indication that sample 3 and 4 are not normally distributed. Both are negatively skewed (figure \ref{fig:skew}).

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Histograms with normal distribution fit with samples containing the number of correctly chosen elements in each task}
\end{figure}

D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirm our visual analysis. Both samples accept the alternative hypothesis with p-values ($0.00443$, $0.00013$) lower than the significant level $0.05$. The null hypothesis is \underline{rejected} and $H_A$ accepted for sample 3 and 4. \\[0.3cm]
\vspace{0.3cm}

Sample 3 and 4 is Box-Cox power transformed because the null hypothesis was rejected. After the transformation, a new D'Agostino and Pearson normality test was performed. Both samples also failed this test. Sample 3 and 4 are not normally distributed and need to be tested with non-parametric methods. 

\subsubsection[Sample 5, 6 and 7]{All participants divided by task, total time variable}\label{sec:task123_time_normaltest}

In this section sample 5, 6 and 7 (table \ref{tab:totaltime_tasks}) is normality tested. These samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference between the three tasks when looking at the total time variable. 

A visual analysis of the three histograms in figure \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinterupted_task1}, \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinterupted_task2} and \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinterupted_task3} show a positive skewness, just like the histograms in figure \ref{fig:sample1,2_histo_original}. This gives an indication that the three samples are not normally distributed.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Histogram with normal distribution fit - sample with total time per task}
\end{figure}

The D'Agostino and Pearson normality test agreed with the visual analysis. Obtained p-values for all three samples ($2.39 * 10^{-24}$, $2.57 * 10^{-9}$ and $1.71 * 10^{-11}$) are smaller than the significance level 0.05, and the null hypothesis is rejected. The samples are not normally distributed with a significant level of 5\%.\\[0.2cm]

Because the null hypothesis was rejected, the samples are Box-Cox power transformed. Histograms of each sample after the transformation is shown in figure \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinteruptedboxcox_task1}, \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinteruptedboxcox_task2} and \ref{fig:totaltimeallnotinteruptedboxcox_task3}. A visual analysis of the histograms gives a good indication that the transformed data is approximately normally distributed. The histograms have a skewness of approximately zero.

	\caption{Histogram with normal distribution fit after Box-Cox transformation, sample with total time per task}
\end{figure}

The D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirms the visual interpretation. The data is normally distributed after Box-Cox with a confidence interval of 95\%. The p-values ($0.164$, $0.982$ and $0.354$) of all three samples are higher than the significance level (0.05). Sample 5, 6 and 7 are normally distributed after the transformation, and the assumptions of normality are met. 
 
 \subsubsection[Sample 8, 9 and 10]{All participants divided by task,  correct element variable}\label{sec:task123_correct_normaltest}
 In this section sample 8, 9 and 10 will be normal distribution examined. These samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference between the three tasks when looking at the number of correctly chosen elements variable. 

A visual analysis of the three histograms in figure \ref{fig:correctallnotinterupted_task1}, \ref{fig:correctallnotinterupted_task2} and \ref{fig:correctallnotinterupted_task3} show a negative skewness, just like the histograms in section \ref{sec:correct_ex_inex}. This give an indication that the three samples are not normally distributed.

 D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirms our visual analysis of the histograms in two of three samples. Sample 9 passes the normality test, even though the p-value ($0.099$) is close to the significance level (0.05). Sample 8 and sample 10 do not pass the normality test with a confidence interval of 95\%. Both samples obtained a p-value ($0.00022$ and $0.0047$) smaller than the significant level. The null hypothesis is rejected for sample 8 and 10, and the alternative hypothesis is accepted. The null hypothesis is accepted for sample 9. The significance level is 5\%. \\[0.2cm]

A Box-Cox power transformation is applied to all three samples. The transformation changes the data, and to correctly compare the results, sample 9 also has to be transformed even though it's original data is normally distributed. The transformed samples are shown in histogram \ref{fig:correctboxcox_task1}, \ref{fig:correctboxcox_task2} and \ref{fig:correctboxcox_task3}. All three are negatively skewed, sample 9 and 10 less than sample 8. A visual conclusion is difficult in this case. \\[0.2cm]

D'Agostino and Pearson normality test accepts the null hypothesis on sample 9 and 10 and rejects it on sample 8. Sample 9 and 10 has p-values ($0.0752$ and$0.2104$) higher than the significance level, while sample 8's p-value ($0.2104$) is significantly lower. When using these three samples in hypothesis tests, a non-parametric method should be used. This is because sample 8 is not normally distributed. 

\subsubsection[Sample 11, 12 and 13]{Experienced participants divided by task, total time variable}
In this section, sample 11, 12, and 13, shown in table \ref{tab:totaltime_tasks_experienced}, is normal distribution tested. The three samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference between the three tasks total time results when considering only experienced participants. 

A visual interpretation of the histograms in \ref{fig:sample11_12_13_histogram} show that all three samples are positively skewed (figure \ref{fig:skew}). Skew gives a fairly strong evidence that the samples are not normally distributed.

Sample 11, 12 and 13 do not pass the normality test with a confidence interval of 95\%. The null hypothesis is rejected. \\[0.2cm]

A Box-Cox power transformation is applied to all three samples since the null hypothesis was rejected. Histograms with normal distribution fit containing the transformed data is shown in figure \ref{fig:sample11_12_13_boxcox_histogram}.

The Box-Cox transformed data is tested with D'Agostino and Pearson normality test. All three samples obtained p-values ($0.694$, $0.955$ and $0.887$) larger than the significance level (0.05). Within a confidence interval of 95\%, the test concludes that sample 11, 12 and 13 is normally distributed. Sample 11, 12 and 13 can be used in methods assuming normally distributed samples. 

\subsubsection[Sample 14, 15 and 16]{Experienced participants divided by task, correct elements variable}
This section will test if sample 14, 15 and 16, shown in table \ref{tab:totalcorrect_tasks_experienced}, follows the normal distribution. The three samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference in the number of correct elements between the three tasks when comparing only experienced participants. 

A visual interpretation of the histograms in \ref{fig:sample14,15,16_normhistogram} show that all three samples are slightly negatively skewed (figure \ref{fig:skew}). Sample 15 (\ref{fig:correctexperienced_task1}) and sample 16 (\ref{fig:correctexperienced_task2}) has less skew than sample 14 (\ref{fig:correctexperienced_task3}).

 D'Agostino and Pearson normality test confirms our visual interpretation of the three histograms. All three p-values ($0.0588$, $0.2067$ and $0.2975$) are higher than the significant level (0.05), notice that sample 14 has a lower p-value than the two other samples. This sample is not as significant as the two other samples. Sample 14, 15 and 16 pass the normality test with a confidence interval of 95\%. The null hypothesis is accepted. Sample 14, 15 and 16 can be used in tests that assume normally distributed samples.

\subsubsection[Sample 17, 18 and 19]{Inexperienced participants divided by task, total time variable}\label{sec:sample_17,18,19_normalitytest}
This section will test if sample 17, 18 and 19, shown in table \ref{tab:totaltime_tasks_inexperienced}, follows the normal distribution. These samples will be used to test whether there is a significant difference in total time between the three tasks when looking at only inexperienced participants.

A visual analysis of the histograms \ref{fig:totaltimeinexperienced_task1}, \ref{fig:totaltimeinexperienced_task2} and \ref{fig:totaltimeinexperienced_task3} show a positive skew. The skew is less than the histograms in figure \ref{fig:sample11_12_13_histogram}, but is most likely too large for the samples to be normally distributed.

Sample 17, 18 and 19 is not normally distributed with a confidence interval of 95\%. The null hypothesis is rejected. \\[0.2cm]

The samples are Box-Cox power transformed. The histograms after transformation (\ref{fig:totaltimeinexperiencedboxcox_task1}, \ref{fig:totaltimeinexperiencedboxcox_task2} and \ref{fig:totaltimeinexperiencedboxcox_task3}) are visually evaluated to be normal distributed.

The obtained p-values ($0.139$, $0.909$ and $0.067$) is smaller than 0.05, and the null hypothesis is accepted. Sample 17, 18, and 19 are normally distributed after Box-Cox and can be used in parametric methods \\[0.2cm]

\subsubsection[Sample 20, 21 and 22]{Inexperienced participants  divided by task, correct elements variable}\label{sec:sample_20,21,22_normalitytest}
Sample 20, 21 and 22, shown in table \ref{tab:totalcorrect_tasks_inexperienced}, contains the number of correctly chosen elements in each of the three tasks from only inexperienced participants. The samples will be used to test if inexperienced participants do better in one of the tasks. 

A visual interpretation of histogram \ref{fig:correctinexperienced_task1}, \ref{fig:correctinexperienced_task2} and \ref{fig:correctinexperienced_task3} show a negative skew, similar to the histograms containing results from only experienced participants (\ref{(fig:fig:sample14,15,16_normhistogram}).

The D'Agostino and Pearson normality test rejects the null hypothesis on sample 20 and 22 and accepts the null hypothesis on sample 21. Obtained p-values ($0.007$ and $0.004$) are lower than 0.05 for sample 20 and 22 and sample 21 ($0.523$) higher than 0.05. The test concludes that sample 21 is normally distributed, and sample 20 and 22 is not with a significant level of 5\%. \newline

A Box-Cox power transformation is applied to all three samples. The transformation changes the data, and to correctly compare the data, sample 21 also has to be transformed even though the original data was followed the normal distribution. The transformed samples are shown in histogram \ref{fig:correctinexperiencedboxcox_task1}, \ref{fig:correctinexperiencedboxcox_task2} and \ref{fig:correctinexperiencedboxcox_task3}.

\subsection{Levene's test of Equality of Variance}\label{sec:levene_test_results}
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:t-test}, \ref{sec:anova} and \ref{sec:mannwhiteyu}, the two sample t-test, one-way \textit{ANOVA} and Mann-Whitey U test assumes that the samples come from populations with equal variances. This assumption will be examined with Levene's test. The hypothesis tested is: \\[0.3cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: Input samples are from populations with equal variances} 
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Input samples are from populations that do not have equal variances}
\vspace{0.3cm}

The null hypothesis is accepted if the obtained p-value is higher than the significance level. Table \ref{tab:levenestest_summary} contains the summary of the Levene's test performed on all sample pairs. All sample pairs accepted the null hypothesis except sample 1 and 2, who obtained a p-value lower than the significance level. The test used a significance level of 5\% on all the tests. \\[0.2cm]

\subsection{Hypothesis testing}\label{sec:hypothesis_results}
This section will test all the hypothesis. The tests order will be the same as the tables in section \ref{sec:gathereddata}. Which statistic test that is used is determined by the results from the normality tests (section \ref{sec:normality_results}) and Levene's test (section \ref{sec:levene_test_results}).

\subsubsection[Sample 1, 2]{Test differences in total time between experienced and inexperienced participants}\label{sec:t-test_result} 
%Two sample t-test results
%\textbf{Test differences between experienced and inexperienced participants}\\
This section will test if there are any difference in total time spent on the tasks between experienced and inexperienced participants. This test is covered by sample 1 and sample 2 from section \ref{sec:totaltime_ex_inex}. Sample 1 is experienced participants and sample 2 inexperienced participants. Both samples was normally distributed after a Box-Cox transformation (\ref{sec:sample1,2_normresult}). A two sample t-test will be used to answer this hypothesis since the normality assumption is valid. The hypothesis tested in this section is: \\[0.3cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: Equal task time between experienced and inexperienced participants} 
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Unequal task time between experienced and inexperienced participants}

\vspace{0.3cm}

If $\overline{x}_1$ equals the mean time for experienced-, and $\overline{x}_2$ the mean time for inexperienced participants, the hypothesis can be written as:\\[0.3cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_1$ = $\overline{x}_2$} 
\centerline{$H_{A}$: $\overline{x}_1$ $\neq$ $\overline{x}_2$}

\vspace{0.3cm}

Since we cannot assume equal variances in the two samples (table \ref{tab:levenestest_summary}), this test will use the Welch's t-test for unequal variances [\citep{Walpole2012}, p. 345]. Equation \ref{eq:ttest_twoway} is still valid. The obtained values from the test is shown in the gray box. The obtained T-statistic is smaller than the critical value. The t-test then conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two population samples with a confidence interval of 95\%.\\[0.2cm]

		Significance level ($\alpha$): 0.05 \\
		Critical value: 1.960\\[0.2cm]
		
		Using equation \ref{eq:ttest_twoway}, the absolute value of the $T-statistic$ is larger than the critical value ($|60.442|$ > $1.960$) and the null hypothesis is \underline{rejected} and $H_A$ accepted.\\[0.5cm]

	\end{tcolorbox} 
\end{center}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Test if experienced or inexperienced participants finish the task fastest} 

Because there was a significant difference between time spent on the tasks, this section will also test who finished the task fastest. The second hypothesis tested in this section is:\newline

%\centerline{$H_{0}$: Inexperienced participants has a lower or equal total time compared to experienced participants.}
\centerline{$H_{0}$: Equal task time between all participants}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Experience participants finish the task faster}

With sample 1 equals experienced participants and sample 2 equals inexperienced participants we get the hypothesis:\\[0.2cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_1$ = $\overline{x}_2$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: $\overline{x}_1$ < $\overline{x}_2$}

This test gives the same T-statistics as the previous test, but the critical value is changed since this test is changed to a two sample, one-way t-test. Since we cannot assume equal variances in the two samples a Welch's test is performed. The test results are shown under. The $T-statistic$ is still smaller than the critical value (-64.654 < 1.645). Our test is to check if sample 1's mean is significantly larger than sample 2's mean, then we use the test written in equation \ref{eq:ttest_greater}. Our $T-statistic$ is not larger than the critical value, therefore we need to accept the null hypothesis. There is no evidence that experienced participants use less time on the tasks than the inexperienced. \\[0.2cm]

Since we know that there is a significant difference between the two sample means, the author concludes that the inexperienced participants finished the task faster than the experienced participants. This can also be seen in plot \ref{fig:meanstdparticipantstime}. Inexperienced participants finished the tasks 16 seconds faster than experienced participants. \newline

\subsubsection[Sample 3, 4]{Test if there is a difference between experienced and inexperienced participants in total correct elements} %Mann-Whitey U Test results
%\textbf{Test differences between experienced and inexperienced participants}\\

This section will test if there is a difference between experienced- and inexperienced participants when looking at the number of correctly chosen elements. Sample 3 and 4 is the correct samples to use in this test. Both samples are not normally distributed, we need to use a non-parametric method. The Mann-Whitey U test is the preferred test to use on these samples. As mentioned in section \ref{sec:Wilcoxon}, the Mann-Whitey U test is preferred when the samples have ties (identical observations) in the data. From histogram \ref{fig:correctelementswasnotinterupter_ex} and \ref{fig:correctelementswasnotinterupted_inex} we see that the samples for both independent variables are similar. Mann-Whitey U test can therefore be used to compare the population medians. The hypothesis to be tested is:\\[0.3cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $median_3$ = $median_4$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: $median_3$ $\neq$ $median_4$}

The results of the test, the statistical value and finding the critical value in the Mann-Whitey U table is shown in the box under. Using equation \ref{eq:mannwhitey-ciritcalvalue} we conclude that there are not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis with a confidence interval of 95\%. The $U-statistic$ is larger than the critical value.

Results from til section show that there is is not enough evidence to conclude that there is any difference between experienced- and inexperienced participants when looking at the number of correctly chosen elements per task. The author concludes that experienced- and inexperienced participants did equally well on the task. 

\subsubsection[Sample 5, 6 and 7]{Test if total time differs between the three tasks}\label{sec:anova_result} %One-way \textit{ANOVA} test results

This section will test if there is a difference in total time between the three tasks in this survey. Sample 5, 6, and 7 is the samples to use in this test. The one-way \textit{ANOVA} test will be used in this section. This test is used when there are more than two samples being compared (section \ref{sec:anova}). The assumption that sample 5, 6 and 7 come from populations with equal variances are met \ref{sec:sample5,6,7}), the samples are also normally distributed after a Box-Cox transformation (\ref{sec:task123_time_normaltest}). The hypothesis tested here is:\\

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_5$ = $\overline{x}_6$ = $\overline{x}_7$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Total time is different between at least two of the tasks}

Using equation \ref{eq:anova_reject} and results shown in the box under, the \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis. The $f-value$ is lower than the critical value. With a confidence interval of 95\% the author claim that there is a difference between the mean value of the three tasks.

	\label{fig:meanstdtask123pngtime}
\end{figure}

Since the null hypothesis was rejected \textit{Tukey's method} will be used to make comparisons between task one, two and three. This test did not find any significant difference between the three tasks. Visual evaluation of figure \ref{fig:meanstdtask123pngtime} show that task 1 was competed slightly faster than the two other tasks.

\end{center}

\vspace{0.3cm}
Based on the results from this section the author concludes that there is a difference in total time between at least two of the tasks, but the difference is not enough. \textit{Tukey's test} can't find a significant difference. 

\subsubsection[Sample 8, 9, and 10]{Test if the number of correct elements differs between the three tasks}\label{sec:sample_8_9_10_kruskal)} %Kruskal-Wallis test results

This section will test if there is a difference in the number of correctly chosen elements between the three survey tests. The test will use sample 8, 9 and 10. Since sample 8 are not normally distributed (\ref{sec:task123_correct_normaltest}) a non-parametric test should be used. The Kruskal-Wallis test is the non-parametric eqvivalent to one-way \textit{ANOVA} (\ref{sec:kruskal-w-test}). It is used to test equality of medians when the samples are not normally distributed. This method will test if there is any difference between task 1, 2 and 3 when looking at the dependent variable number of correctly chosen elements. The hypothesis tested is: \\[0.2cm]

\centerline{$H_{0}$: $median_8$ = $median_9$ = $median_10$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Number of correctly chosen elements is different between at least two of the tasks}

Using equation \ref{eq:kruskapw-accept}, the Kruskal-Wallis test rejects the null hypothesis. The obtained $H-value$ is smaller than the critical value found. P-value is approximately zero and this gives a good indication that the result is significant. With a confidence interval of 95\% the author claim that there is a difference between the median value of the three tasks. \\[0.2cm]

Like in one-way \textit{ANOVA}, a \textit{post hoc} test should be used to make paired comparisons to determine which groups differ. The \textit{post hoc} test used in this section is Tukey's test. Results from Tukey's test resulted in a significant difference in the number of correctly chosen elements between task 1 and task 2, and task 1 and task 3. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdtask123pngcorrect} show that task 1 has a higher mean value than the other two tasks. Task 1 also has a smaller standard deviation than the other tasks. \\[0.2cm]

The results in this section find significant evidence that the participants had a higher number of correct elements in task 1 than in the two other tasks. 

\subsubsection[Sample 11 - 16]{Test differenced in results from experienced participants between task 1, 2 and 3}\label{sec:sample_11_12_13_anova}
This section will answer two hypothesis about experienced participant's results divided in task 1, 2 and 3. Sample 11, 12 and 13 will be used to answer the first hypothesis. These three samples are normally distributed after a Box-Cox transformation (\ref{tab:normaltest_summary}) and also come from populations with equal variances (\ref{sec:sample11,12,13_levene}). Sample 14, 15 and 16 will be used on the second hypothesis. All three samples are normally distributed (\ref{tab:normaltest_summary}) and also come from populations with equal variances (\ref{sec:sample14,15,16_levene}). The one-way \textit{ANOVA} method will be used to test both hypotheses. The first hypothesis will test if time spent on each of the three tasks differ and the second hypothesis will test if the number of correct elements in each of the three tasks differs when the samples only include results from experienced participants. 

The first hypothesis is:\\
\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_{11}$ = $\overline{x}_{12}$ = $\overline{x}_{13}$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Total time is different between at least two of the tasks}

Using equation \ref{eq:anova_reject}, the one-way \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis. The obtained $f-value$ ($1216.919$) is higher than the critical value ($3.00$). The calculated p-value is also approximately zero and this gives a good indication that the result is significant. With a confidence interval of 95\% the author claim that there is a time difference between the three tasks. 

When the null hypothesis is rejected a \textit{post hoc} test is used to compare each task with each other. Tukey's \textit{post hos} test did not find any significant difference between the three tasks with a significant level of 5\%. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123time} show an approximately similar mean value in all three tasks. %task 2 has a lower mean and less standard deviation. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../../thesis-statisticmethods/statistic_analysis/figures/boxplot/mean_std_experienced_task123_time}
	\caption{Sample 11, 12 and 13 - mean (green dot) and standard deviation (blue line)}
	\label{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123time}
\end{figure}

The author concludes that there is a significant difference between at least two of the tasks when looking at experienced participants mean task time, but the difference is not enough so that \textit{Tukey's test} can find which tasks that differ. \newline

The second hypothesis is:\\
\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_11$ = $\overline{x}_12$ = $\overline{x}_13$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Correct elements in each task is different between at least two of the tasks}

Using equation \ref{eq:anova_reject}, the one-way \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis. The obtained $f-value$ ($8.210$) is higher than the critical value ($3.00$). The p-value is also approximately zero and this gives a good indication that the result is significant. With a confidence interval of 95\% the author claim that there is a difference between the mean value of at least two of the tasks. 

Since the null hypothesis was rejected, a \textit{post hoc} test should be used to make paired comparisons to determine which groups differ. Tukey's \textit{post-hoc} test resulted in a significant difference in the number of correctly chosen elements between task 1 and task 2, and task 1 and task 3. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123correct} show that task 1 has a higher mean value than the two other tasks. Task 1 also has a smaller standard deviation.

\end{figure}

\vspace{0.3cm}

With the results found in this section, the author concludes that there is a significant difference in the number of correctly chosen elements between the three tasks. The experienced participants got the best result on task 1. Time spent on each task also differ between at least two of the tasks, but the difference is not significant enough so that Tukey's test can determine a difference. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdexperiencedtask123time} show that task 2 has the lowest mean time value of the three tasks.  


\subsubsection[Sample 17 -  22]{Test differenced in results from inexperienced participants between task 1, 2 and 33}\label{sec:sample_17_18_19_anova}

This section will answer the same hypothesis at the previous section, only with results from inexperienced participants. Sample 17, 18 and 19 will be used on the first hypothesis. These samples are normally distributed (\ref{sec:sample_17,18,19_normalitytest}) and come from populations with equal variances (\ref{sec:sample17,18,19_levene}). Sample 20, 21 and 22 will be used on the second hypothesis. All three samples are normally distributed (\ref{sec:sample_20,21,22_normalitytest}) and also come from populations with equal variances (\ref{sec:sample20,21,22_levene}). The one-way \textit{ANOVA} will be used to test both hypotheses. The first hypothesis will test if time spent on each task differ and the second hypothesis will test if the number of correct elements in each task differs.

The first hypothesis is:\\
\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_{17}$ = $\overline{x}_{18}$ = $\overline{x}_{19}$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Total time is different between at least two of the tasks}

The one-way \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis and accepts the alternative hypothesis ($H_{A}$) with a significant level of 5\%. The obtained f-value from the test is higher than the critical value ($905.34$ > $3.00$). Since the alternative hypothesis was accepted, Tukey's \textit{post hoc} test is used to make compared comparisons between task 1, task 2 and task 3. The test doesn't find a significant difference when comparing each of the three tasks with a significant level of 5\%. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123time} show that inexperienced participants spent more time on task 2 than the other tasks, but the difference is not significant according to Tukey's test.

	\caption{Mean (green dot) and standard deviation (blue line) for sample 17, 18 and 19}
	\label{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123time}
\end{figure}

The seconds hypothesis is:\\
\centerline{$H_{0}$: $\overline{x}_{20}$ = $\overline{x}_{21}$ = $\overline{x}_{22}$}
\centerline{$H_{A}$: Number of correct elements is different between at least two of the tasks}

The one-way \textit{ANOVA} test rejects the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and accepts the alternative hypothesis ($H_{A}$) with a significance level of 5\%. The obtained f-value from the test is higher than the critical value ($189.05$ > $3.00$). Since the null hypothesis was rejected Tukey's \textit{post hoc} test will be used to make comparisons between the three tasks. This test cannot find a significant difference when comparing the tasks with a significant level of 5\%. Looking at figure \ref{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123correct}, task 1 has a higher mean time value than the two other tasks, also task 2 has a higher mean than task 3. Even though there are differences in the number of correct elements between the tasks, it is not significant according to Tukey's test. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{../../thesis-statisticmethods/statistic_analysis/figures/boxplot/mean_std_inexperienced_task123_correct}
	\caption{Mean (green dot) and standard deviation (blue line) for sample 20, 21 and 22}
	\label{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123correct}
\end{figure}

With the results found in this section, the author concludes that there is a significant difference in both total time spent on each task and the number of correctly chosen elements between at least two of the tasks. The differences are not significant enough so that Tukey's test can determine which task differs. Figure \ref{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123time} and \ref{fig:meanstdinexperiencedtask123correct} show that task 1 has the lowest mean time value and the highest mean correct value.
