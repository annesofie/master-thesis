@article{Coleman2009,
abstract = {Advances in positioning, Web mapping, cellular communications and wiki technologies have surpassed the original visions of GSDI programs around the world. By tapping the distributed knowledge, personal time and energy of volunteer contributors, GI voluntarism is beginning to relocate and redistribute selected GI productive activities from mapping agencies to networks of non-state volunteer actors. Participants in the production process are both users and producers, or ‘produsers' to use a recent neologism. Indeed, GI voluntarism ultimately has the potential to redistribute the rights to define and judge the value of the produced geographic information and of the new production system in general. The concept and its implementation present a rich collection of both opportunities and risks now being considered by leaders of public and private mapping organizations world-wide. In this paper, the authors describe and classify both the types of people who volunteer geospatial information and the nature of their contributions. Combining empirical research dealing with the Open Source software and Wikipedia communities with input from selected national mapping agencies and private companies, the authors offer different taxonomies that can help researchers clarify what is at stake with respect to geospatial information contributors. They identify early lessons which may be drawn from this research, and suggest questions which may be posed by large mapping organizations when considering the potential opportunities and risks associated with encouraging and employing Volunteered Geographic Information in their programs.},

Sites such as Wikimapia and OpenStreetMap are empowering citizens to create a global patchwork of geographic information, while Google Earth and other virtual globes are encouraging volunteers to develop interesting applications using their own data. I review this phenomenon, and examine associated issues: what drives people to do this, how accurate are the results, will they threaten individual privacy, and how can they augment more conventional sources? I compare this new phenomenon to more traditional citizen science and the role of the amateur in geographic observation},

Examining the effect of the changing cartography has on data collection using OSM crowdsourcing as a case study. Are parallels to what is happening with data collection in other aspects, like WIKIPEDIA, Flickr and YouTube. 
  
Today: A need for instant information, particularly in crisis situations 
User Generated Content providers / crowdsourced data collectors are allowed to collect geodata 
Reason: More available satellite imagery, cheaper GPS units, etc 
OSM the leading global example 
OSM was the first online mapping service to accurately map and display the new London Heathrow Terminal 5, on the official opening day. 
OSM project (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/No:Main{\_}Page) - the achieved coverage, its accuracy, availability and global impact are all changing the way individuals and org are thinking about the collection, purchase and use of geodata. 
Makes OSM stand out from other data sources: 
Completely free of charge 
Is released under a license which allows you to do pretty much what you like 
As long as you mention the original creator and the license 
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap{\_}License 
The availability, accuracy and price of OSM data has lead some local authorities in the UK to question the need to have total reliance on being locked into a contract for their geodata with the National Mapping Agency. 
OSM gives the possibility of having really current data available, other services may have a large lead for getting the data from survey to map output. 
OSM have specialist maps for cycling, routing, applications, skiing, topography and for maritime use.},

@article{Zielstra2013,
abstract = {The assessment of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data quality has become an interdisciplinary research area over the recent years. The question of whether the OSM road network should be updated through periodic data imports from public domain data, or whether the currency of OSM data should rather rely on more traditional data collection efforts by active contributors, has led to perpetual debates within the OSM community. A US Census TIGER/Line 2005 import into OSM was accomplished in early 2008, which generated a road network foundation for the active community members in the US. In this study we perform a longitudinal analysis of road data for the US by comparing the development of OSM and TIGER/Line data since the initial TIGER/Line import. The analysis is performed for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, and 70 Urbanized Areas. In almost all tested states and Urbanized Areas, OSM misses roads for motorized traffic when compared with TIGER/Line street data, while significant contributions could be observed in pedestrian related network data in OSM compared with corresponding TIGER/Line data. We conclude that the quality of OSM road data could be improved through new OSM editor tools allowing contributors to trace current TIGER/Line data.},

abstract = {Crowd sourcing geographic data is an opensource geographic data which is contributed by lots of non-professionals and provided to the public. The typical crowd sourcing geographic data contains GPS track data like OpenStreetMap, collaborative map data like Wikimapia, social websites like Twitter and Facebook, POI signed by Jiepang user and so on. These data will provide canonical geographic information for pubic after treatment. As compared with conventional geographic data collection and update method, the crowd sourcing geographic data from the non-professional has characteristics or advantages of large data volume, high currency, abundance information and low cost and becomes a research hotspot of international geographic information science in the recent years. Large volume crowd sourcing geographic data with high currency provides a new solution for geospatial database updating while it need to solve the quality problem of crowd sourcing geographic data obtained from the non-professionals. In this paper, a quality analysis model for OpenStreetMap crowd sourcing geographic data is proposed. Firstly, a quality analysis framework is designed based on data characteristic analysis of OSM data. Secondly, a quality assessment model for OSM data by three different quality elements: completeness, thematic accuracy and positional accuracy is presented. Finally, take the OSM data of Wuhan for instance, the paper analyses and assesses the quality of OSM data with 2011 version of navigation map for reference. The result shows that the high-level roads and urban traffic network of OSM data has a high positional accuracy and completeness so that these OSM data can be used for updating of urban road network database.},

abstract = {Open-source software development projects are almost always collaborative and distributed. Despite the difficulties imposed by distance, these projects have managed to produce large, complex, and successful systems. However, there is still little known about how open-source teams manage their collaboration. In this paper we look at one aspect of this issue: how distributed developers maintain group awareness. We interviewed developers, read project communication, and looked at project artifacts from three successful open source projects. We found that distributed developers do need to maintain awareness of one another, and that they maintain both a general awareness of the entire team and more detailed knowledge of people that they plan to work with. Although there are several sources of information, this awareness is maintained primarily through text-based communication (mailing lists and chat systems). These textual channels have several characteristics that help to support the maintenance of awareness, as long as developers are committed to reading the lists and to making their project communication public.},

Introduce the concept "Crowd Quality" (CQ) to describe and quantify the quality of crowdsourced geospatial information. Together with the growth in volume, the usage of crowdsourced geospatial info. grew extensively as well. 
  
Quality: Has a meaning if we have a common understanding of its definition 
ISO19113(2002): Quality is the "totality of characteristics of a product that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs".  
Van Oort: Identified eleven elements of spatial data quality. The elements are used to describe the quality of geo-data collected and produced. 
Uniform method to produce and process the data --{\textgreater} Homogenous and consistent quality 
Crowd Quality (CQ): 
2 dim.: 
User-related quality aspects: Quality of information from an individual contributors perspective. This is the typical char. of crowdsourced data. 
Feature-related quality aspects: Perspective of the spatial feature. 
  
3 components: Local Knowledge, Experience and Recognition. 
Familiarity to an area can be correlated to the quality of the users contribution 
Quality of a users contribution is correlated with his overall experience in contributing to the project 
Online social networks that allow for user contributions, often feedback are established (ratings, recognition for specific contributions). This type of User recognition is largely unknown in crowdsourced geospatial data --{\textgreater} Puts a strain in our ability to assess CQ. 
In crowdsources datasets quality elements can be different for similar features, one user can add his personal attributes when adding a restaurant in OSM, while another restaurant only have one attribute. In traditional datasets the quality elements will be uniform, have the same attributes. 
Quality elements that are particular interesting, since they are not consistent for crowdsourced data: 
Lineage, positional accuracy and sematic accuracy.  
When data is imported from other sources, these imported features have a very clear lineage with regard to positional accuracy and precision. When imported from GPS data, the positional accuracy is harder to establish. 
Sematic accuracy  - related to the completeness and internal consistency of the attribute metadata. A schema for attribute metadata is not common in crowdsources geospatial data projects --{\textgreater} Create a threat to internal consistency.},

@article{Soden,
abstract = {The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010 catalyzed a nas-cent set of efforts in then-emergent ''volunteer technology communities.'' Among these was the response from OpenStreetMap, a volunteer-driven project that makes geospatial data free and openly available. Following the earthquake, remotely located volunteers rapidly mapped the affected areas to support the aid effort in a remarkable display of crowdsourced work. However, some within that effort believed that the impact and import of open and collaborative mapping techniques could provide much richer value to humanitarian aid work and the long-term development needs of the country. They launched an ambitious project that trialed methods for how to create sustainable and locally-owned community-mapping ecosystems in at-risk regions of the world. This paper describes how an organi-zation that emerged out of the response—the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team—formalized their practices in relation to many different stakeholder needs with the aim for setting a model for how the potential of participatory, community mapping could be realized in Haiti and beyond.},

abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a volunteer-driven, globally distributed organization whose members work to create a common digital map of the world. OSM embraces ideals of open data, and to that end innovates both socially and technically to develop practices and processes for coordinated operation. This paper provides a brief history of OSM and then, through quantitative and qualitative examination of the OSM database and other sites of articulation work, examines organizational growth through the lens of two catastrophes that spurred enormous humanitarian relief responses—the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda. The temporally- and geographically- constrained events scope analysis for what is a rapidly maturing, whole-planet operation. The first disaster identified how OSM could support other organizations responding to the event. However, to achieve this, OSM has had to refine mechanisms of collaboration around map creation, which were tested again in Typhoon Yolanda. The transformation of work between these two events yields insights into the organizational development of large, data-producing online organizations.},

Individuals are only required to work on small chunks of tasks during their bits of short free times during the day.

We focus on writing and editing, com-plex endeavors that span many levels of conceptual and pragmatic activity. Authoring tools offer help with pragmat-ics, but for higher-level help, writers commonly turn to other people. We thus present Soylent, a word processing interface that enables writers to call on Mechanical Turk workers to shorten, proofread, and otherwise edit parts of their docu-ments on demand. To improve worker quality, we introduce the Find-Fix-Verify crowd programming pattern, which splits tasks into a series of generation and review stages. Evaluation studies demonstrate the feasibility of crowdsourced editing and investigate questions of reliability, cost, wait time, and work time for edits.},

@article{Neis2012,
abstract = {The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, founded in 2004, has gathered an exceptional amount of interest in recent years and counts as one of the most impressive sources of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) on the Internet. In total, more than half a million members had registered for the project by the end of 2011. However, while this number of contributors seems impressive, questions remain about the individual contributions that have been made by the project members. This research article contains several studies regarding the contributions by the community of the project. The results show that only 38{\%} (192,000) of the registered members carried out at least one edit in the OSM database and that only 5{\%} (24,000) of all members actively contributed to the project in a more productive way. The majority of the members are located in Europe (72{\%}) and each member has an activity area whose size may range from one soccer field up to more than 50 km2. In addition to several more analyses conducted for this article, predictions will be made about how this newly acquired knowledge can be used for future research.},
