abstract = {The last decade of research in ontology alignment has brought a va-riety of computational techniques to discover correspondences between ontolo-gies. While the accuracy of automatic approaches has continuously improved, human contributions remain a key ingredient of the process: this input serves as a valuable source of domain knowledge that is used to train the algorithms and to validate and augment automatically computed alignments. In this paper, we introduce CROWDMAP, a model to acquire such human contributions via micro-task crowdsourcing. For a given pair of ontologies, CROWDMAP translates the alignment problem into microtasks that address individual alignment questions, publishes the microtasks on an online labor market, and evaluates the quality of the results obtained from the crowd. We evaluated the current implementation of CROWDMAP in a series of experiments using ontologies and reference align-ments from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative and the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the overall ap-proach is feasible, and can improve the accuracy of existing ontology alignment solutions in a fast, scalable, and cost-effective manner.},

abstract = {Advancements in Internet and digital technologies have enabled a new work form of open sourcing, which we refer to as the crowdsourcing work environment (CSWE). This new form of work has the potential to disrupt and transform the nature of traditional work. However, our understanding of this new work form is still in its incipient stage. To enhance our understanding, this study captures crowdworkers' perceptions to explore the characteristics of the crowdworkers, crowdsourcing jobs, and the crowdwork environment that collectively drive the crowdworkers to participate in open source work. Guided by the job characteristic theory and work value perspectives, we used the revealed causal mapping method to analyze narratives by 55 crowdworkers registered on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Our data analysis uncovered nine main constructs, 22 key concepts, and 815 causal-effect linkages surrounding CSWE that could guide our theoretical understanding of this emerging phenomenon. Individual needs and the crowdwork context emerged as the major factors motivating individuals' initial participation in CSWE, but we found crowdsourcing task characteristics (e.g., job autonomy, task variety, task significance, task instruction, and task compensation) and a digitally enabled environment (e.g., system affordance and MTurk governance) to shape crowdworkers' continued participation in CSWE. The findings suggest several promising research streams, including the psychological factors (i.e., personal growth needs and work values) and social outcomes (i.e., empowerment or exploitation of crowdworkers) for examining the psychology and sociology of crowdsourcing work.},

abstract = {In two studies, we investigated whether a recently developed psychometric instrument can differentiate intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load. Study I revealed a similar three-factor solution for language learning (n = 108) and a statistics lecture (n = 174), and statistics exam scores correlated negatively with the factors assumed to represent intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load during the lecture. In Study II, university freshmen who studied applications of Bayes' theorem in example–example (n = 18) or example–problem (n = 18) condition demonstrated better posttest performance than their peers who studied the applications in problem–example (n = 18) or problem–problem (n = 20) condition, and a slightly modified version of the aforementioned psychometric instrument could help researchers to differentiate intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. The findings provide support for a recent reconceptualization of germane cognitive load as referring to the actual working memory resources devoted to dealing with intrinsic cognitive load.},

abstract = {—With the rapid development of smartphones, spatial crowdsourcing platforms are getting popular. A foundational research of spatial crowdsourcing is to allocate micro-tasks to suitable crowd workers. Most existing studies focus on offline scenarios, where all the spatiotemporal information of micro-tasks and crowd workers is given. However, they are impractical since micro-tasks and crowd workers in real applications appear dynamically and their spatiotemporal information cannot be known in advance. In this paper, to address the shortcomings of existing offline approaches, we first identify a more practical micro-task allocation problem, called the Global Online Micro-task Allocation in spatial crowdsourcing (GOM A) problem. We first extend the state-of-art algorithm for the online maximum weighted bipartite matching problem to the GOMA problem as the baseline algorithm. Although the baseline algorithm provides theoretical guarantee for the worst case, its average performance in practice is not good enough since the worst case happens with a very low probability in real world. Thus, we consider the average performance of online algorithms, a.k.a online random order model. We propose a two-phase-based framework, based on which we present the TGOA algorithm with 1 4 -competitive ratio under the online random order model. To improve its efficiency, we further design the TGOA-Greedy algorithm following the framework, which runs faster than the TGOA algorithm but has lower competitive ratio of 1 8 . Finally, we verify the effective-ness and efficiency of the proposed methods through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets.},

abstract = {Due to financial or administrative constraints, access to official spatial base data is currently limited to a small subset of all potential users in the field of spatial planning and research. This increases the usefulness of Volunteered Geographic Information  (VGI), in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), as supplementary datasets or, in some cases, alternative sources of primary data. In contrast to the OSM street network, which has already been thoroughly investigated and found to be practically complete in many areas, the degree of completeness of OSM data on buildings is still unclear. In this paper we describe methods to analyze building completeness and apply these to various test areas in Germany. Official data from national mapping and cadastral agencies is used as a basis for comparison. The results show that unit-based completeness measurements (e.g., total number or area of buildings) are highly sensitive to disparities in modeling between official data and VGI. Therefore, we recommend object-based methods to study the completeness of OSM building footprint data. An analysis from November 2011 in Germany indicated a completeness of 25{\%} in the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and 15{\%} in Saxony. Although further analyses from 2012 confirm that data completeness in Saxony has risen to 23{\%}, the rate of new data input was slowing in the year 2012.},

However, the costs involved in engaging users often requires practitioners to trade off between sample size, time requirements, and monetary costs. Micro-task markets, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, offer a potential paradigm for engaging a large number of users for low time and monetary costs. Here we investigate the utility of a micro-task market for collecting user measurements, and discuss design considerations for developing remote micro user evaluation tasks. Although micro-task markets have great potential for rapidly collecting user measurements at low costs, we found that special care is needed in formulating tasks in order to harness the capabilities of the approach.},
