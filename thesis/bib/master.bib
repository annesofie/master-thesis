abstract = {The idea that closer things are more related than distant things, known as ‘Tobler's first law of geography', is fundamental to understanding many spatial processes. If this concept applies to volunteered geographic information (VGI), it could help to efficiently allocate tasks in citizen science campaigns and help to improve the overall quality of collected data. In this paper, we use classifications of satellite imagery by volunteers from around the world to test whether local familiarity with landscapes helps their performance. Our results show that volunteers identify cropland slightly better within their home country, and do slightly worse as a function of linear distance between their home and the location represented in an image. Volunteers with a professional background in remote sensing or land cover did no better than the general population at this task, but they did not show the decline with distance that was seen among other participants. Even in a landscape where pasture is easily confused for cropland, regional residents demonstrated no advantage. Where we did find evidence for local knowledge aiding classification performance, the realized impact of this effect was tiny. Rather, the inherent difficulty of a task is a much more important predictor of volunteer performance. These findings suggest that, at least for simple tasks, the geographical origin of VGI volunteers has little impact on their ability to complete image classifications.},

Academic work includes Deng and Joshi (2013), who explored crowd workers' perceptions of microtask CS as a career choice, finding that work flexibility and work autonomy were the two major positive aspects.

Camos, 2004), the cognitive load a given task involves is a function of the proportion of time during which it captures attention, thus impeding other attention-demanding processes. Accordingly, the present study demon-strates that the disruptive effect on concurrent maintenance of memory retrievals and response selections increases with their duration. Moreover, the effect on recall performance of concurrent activities does not go beyond their duration insofar as the processes are attention demanding. Finally, these effects are not modality specific, as spatial processing was found to disrupt verbal maintenance. These results suggest a sequential and time-based function of working memory in which processing and storage rely on a single and general purpose attentional resource needed to run executive processes devoted to constructing, maintaining, and modifying ephemeral representations.},

abstract = {The last decade of research in ontology alignment has brought a va-riety of computational techniques to discover correspondences between ontolo-gies. While the accuracy of automatic approaches has continuously improved, human contributions remain a key ingredient of the process: this input serves as a valuable source of domain knowledge that is used to train the algorithms and to validate and augment automatically computed alignments. In this paper, we introduce CROWDMAP, a model to acquire such human contributions via micro-task crowdsourcing. For a given pair of ontologies, CROWDMAP translates the alignment problem into microtasks that address individual alignment questions, publishes the microtasks on an online labor market, and evaluates the quality of the results obtained from the crowd. We evaluated the current implementation of CROWDMAP in a series of experiments using ontologies and reference align-ments from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative and the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the overall ap-proach is feasible, and can improve the accuracy of existing ontology alignment solutions in a fast, scalable, and cost-effective manner.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t In two studies, we investigated whether a recently developed psychometric instrument can differentiate intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load. Study I revealed a similar three-factor solution for language learning (n ¼ 108) and a statistics lecture (n ¼ 174), and statistics exam scores correlated negatively with the factors assumed to represent intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load during the lecture. In Study II, university freshmen who studied applications of Bayes' theorem in exampleeexample (n ¼ 18) or exampleeproblem (n ¼ 18) condition demonstrated better posttest performance than their peers who studied the applications in problemeexample (n ¼ 18) or problemeproblem (n ¼ 20) con-dition, and a slightly modified version of the aforementioned psychometric instrument could help re-searchers to differentiate intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. The findings provide support for a recent reconceptualization of germane cognitive load as referring to the actual working memory re-sources devoted to dealing with intrinsic cognitive load.},

@article{Fan2014,
abstract = {In the past two years, several applications of generating three-dimensional (3D) buildings from OpenStreetMap (OSM) have been made available, for instance, OSM-3D, OSM2World, OSM Building, etc. In these projects, 3D buildings are reconstructed using the buildings' footprints and information about their attributes, which are documented as tags in OSM. Therefore, the quality of 3D buildings relies strongly on the quality of the building footprints data in OSM. This article is dedicated to a quality assessment of building footprints data in OSM for the German city of Munich, which is one of the most developed cities in OSM. The data are evaluated in terms of completeness, semantic accuracy, position accuracy, and shape accuracy by using building footprints in ATKIS (German Authority Topographic–Cartographic Information System) as reference data. The process contains three steps: finding correspondence between OSM and ATKIS data, calculating parameters of the four quality criteria, and statistical analysis. The results show that OSM footprint data in Munich have a high completeness and semantic accuracy. There is an offset of about four meters on average in terms of position accuracy. With respect to shape, OSM building footprints have a high similarity to those in ATKIS data. However, some architectural details are missing; hence, the OSM footprints can be regarded as a simplified version of those in ATKIS data.},

We focus on writing and editing, com-plex endeavors that span many levels of conceptual and pragmatic activity. Authoring tools offer help with pragmat-ics, but for higher-level help, writers commonly turn to other people. We thus present Soylent, a word processing interface that enables writers to call on Mechanical Turk workers to shorten, proofread, and otherwise edit parts of their docu-ments on demand. To improve worker quality, we introduce the Find-Fix-Verify crowd programming pattern, which splits tasks into a series of generation and review stages. Evaluation studies demonstrate the feasibility of crowdsourced editing and investigate questions of reliability, cost, wait time, and work time for edits.},

It provides an easy-to-understand score from 0 (negative) to 100 (positive). While a 100-point scale is intuitive in many respects and allows for relative judgments, information describing how the numeric score translates into an absolute judgment of usability is not known. To help answer that question, a seven-point adjective-anchored Likert scale was added as an eleventh question to nearly 1,000 SUS surveys. Results show that the Likert scale scores correlate extremely well with the SUS scores (r=0.822). The addition of the adjective rating scale to the SUS may help practitioners interpret individual SUS scores and aid in explaining the results to non-human factors professionals.},
