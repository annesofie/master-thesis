abstract = {There is much interest in the opportunities for formal scientific investigations afforded by crowdsourcing and citizen sensing activities. However, one of the critical research issues relates to the 'quality' of the data collected in this way. This paper uses volunteer data on land cover collected under the Geo-Wiki system, where contributors label the land cover class at a series of locations, with expert labels at the same locations. It examines the statistical relationships between the accuracy of volunteer labels, their self assessed confidence in labelling, their 'experiential distance' to the location under consideration and the level of their domain expertise. The results show that distance has a minor effect on the reliability of land cover labelling, and that generally expertise has a greater effect, but not for all land cover classes.},

abstract = {The System Usability Scale (SUS) is an inexpensive, yet effective tool for assessing the usability of a product, including Web sites, cell phones, interactive voice response systems, TV applications, and more. It provides an easy-to-understand score from 0 (negative) to 100 (positive). While a 100-point scale is intuitive in many respects and allows for relative judgments, information describing how the numeric score translates into an absolute judgment of usability is not known. To help answer that question, a seven-point adjective-anchored Likert scale was added as an eleventh question to nearly 1,000 SUS surveys. Results show that the Likert scale scores correlate extremely well with the SUS scores (r=0.822). The addition of the adjective rating scale to the SUS may help practitioners interpret individual SUS scores and aid in explaining the results to non-human factors professionals.},

Examining the effect of the changing cartography has on data collection using OSM crowdsourcing as a case study. Are parallels to what is happening with data collection in other aspects, like WIKIPEDIA, Flickr and YouTube. 
  
Today: A need for instant information, particularly in crisis situations 
User Generated Content providers / crowdsourced data collectors are allowed to collect geodata 
Reason: More available satellite imagery, cheaper GPS units, etc 
OSM the leading global example 
OSM was the first online mapping service to accurately map and display the new London Heathrow Terminal 5, on the official opening day. 
OSM project (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/No:Main{\_}Page) - the achieved coverage, its accuracy, availability and global impact are all changing the way individuals and org are thinking about the collection, purchase and use of geodata. 
Makes OSM stand out from other data sources: 
Completely free of charge 
Is released under a license which allows you to do pretty much what you like 
As long as you mention the original creator and the license 
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap{\_}License 
The availability, accuracy and price of OSM data has lead some local authorities in the UK to question the need to have total reliance on being locked into a contract for their geodata with the National Mapping Agency. 
OSM gives the possibility of having really current data available, other services may have a large lead for getting the data from survey to map output. 
OSM have specialist maps for cycling, routing, applications, skiing, topography and for maritime use.},

abstract = {According to the time-based resource-sharing model (P. Barrouillet, S. Bernardin, {\&} V. Camos, 2004), the cognitive load a given task involves is a function of the proportion of time during which it captures attention, thus impeding other attention-demanding processes. Accordingly, the present study demon-strates that the disruptive effect on concurrent maintenance of memory retrievals and response selections increases with their duration. Moreover, the effect on recall performance of concurrent activities does not go beyond their duration insofar as the processes are attention demanding. Finally, these effects are not modality specific, as spatial processing was found to disrupt verbal maintenance. These results suggest a sequential and time-based function of working memory in which processing and storage rely on a single and general purpose attentional resource needed to run executive processes devoted to constructing, maintaining, and modifying ephemeral representations.},

abstract = {The last decade of research in ontology alignment has brought a va-riety of computational techniques to discover correspondences between ontolo-gies. While the accuracy of automatic approaches has continuously improved, human contributions remain a key ingredient of the process: this input serves as a valuable source of domain knowledge that is used to train the algorithms and to validate and augment automatically computed alignments. In this paper, we introduce CROWDMAP, a model to acquire such human contributions via micro-task crowdsourcing. For a given pair of ontologies, CROWDMAP translates the alignment problem into microtasks that address individual alignment questions, publishes the microtasks on an online labor market, and evaluates the quality of the results obtained from the crowd. We evaluated the current implementation of CROWDMAP in a series of experiments using ontologies and reference align-ments from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative and the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower. The experiments clearly demonstrated that the overall ap-proach is feasible, and can improve the accuracy of existing ontology alignment solutions in a fast, scalable, and cost-effective manner.},

@article{Osborne2010,
abstract = {Many of us in the social sciences deal with data that do not conform to assumptions of normality and/or homoscedasticity/homogeneity of variance. Some research has shown that parametric tests (e.g., multiple regression, ANOVA) can be robust to modest violations of these assumptions. Yet the reality is that almost all analyses (even nonparametric tests) benefit from improved the normality of variables, particularly where substantial non-normality is present. While many are familiar with select traditional transformations (e.g., square root, log, inverse) for improving normality, the Box-Cox transformation (Box {\&} Cox, 1964) represents a family of power transformations that incorporates and extends the traditional options to help researchers easily find the optimal normalizing transformation for each variable. As such, Box-Cox represents a potential best practice where normalizing data or equalizing variance is desired. This paper briefly presents an overview of traditional normalizing transformations and how Box-Cox incorporates, extends, and improves on these traditional approaches to normalizing data. Examples of applications are presented, and details of how to automate and use this technique in SPSS and SAS are included.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTWithin the human computation paradigm, gamification is increasingly gaining interest. This is because an enjoyable experience generated by game features can be a powerful approach to attract participants. Although potentially useful, little research has been conducted into understanding the effectiveness of gamification in human computation. In this experimental study, we operationalized effectiveness as perceived engagement and user acceptance and examined it by comparing the performance of a gamified human computation system against a non-gamified version. We also investigate the determinants of acceptance and how their effects differ between these two systems. Analysis of our data found that participants experienced more engagement and showed higher behavioral intentions toward the gamified system. Moreover, perceived output quality and perceived engagement were significant determinants of acceptance of the gamified system. In contrast, determinants for acceptance of the non-gamified system wer...},

abstract = {There is currently a lack of in-situ environmental data for the calibration and validation of remotely sensed products and for the development and verification of models. Crowdsourcing is increasingly being seen as one potentially powerful way of increasing the supply of in-situ data but there are a number of concerns over the subsequent use of the data, in particular over data quality. This paper examined crowdsourced data from the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing tool for land cover validation to determine whether there were significant differences in quality between the answers provided by experts and non-experts in the domain of remote sensing and therefore the extent to which crowdsourced data describing human impact and land cover can be used in further scientific research. The results showed that there was little difference between experts and non-experts in identifying human impact although results varied by land cover while experts were better than non-experts in identifying the land cover type. This suggests the need to create training materials with more examples in those areas where difficulties in identification were encountered, and to offer some method for contributors to reflect on the information they contribute, perhaps by feeding back the evaluations of their contributed data or by making additional training materials available. Accuracies were also found to be higher when the volunteers were more consistent in their responses at a given location and when they indicated higher confidence, which suggests that these additional pieces of information could be used in the development of robust measures of quality in the future.},

This paper provides a brief history of OSM and then, through quantitative and qualitative examination of the OSM database and other sites of articulation work, examines organizational growth through the lens of two catastrophes that spurred enormous humanitarian relief responses—the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda. The temporally- and geographically- constrained events scope analysis for what is a rapidly maturing, whole-planet operation. The first disaster identified how OSM could support other organizations responding to the event. However, to achieve this, OSM has had to refine mechanisms of collaboration around map creation, which were tested again in Typhoon Yolanda. The transformation of work between these two events yields insights into the organizational development of large, data-producing online organizations.},

abstract = {The idea that closer things are more related than distant things, known as ‘Tobler's first law of geography', is fundamental to understanding many spatial processes. If this concept applies to volunteered geographic information (VGI), it could help to efficiently allocate tasks in citizen science campaigns and help to improve the overall quality of collected data. In this paper, we use classifications of satellite imagery by volunteers from around the world to test whether local familiarity with landscapes helps their performance. Our results show that volunteers identify cropland slightly better within their home country, and do slightly worse as a function of linear distance between their home and the location represented in an image. Volunteers with a professional background in remote sensing or land cover did no better than the general population at this task, but they did not show the decline with distance that was seen among other participants. Even in a landscape where pasture is easily confused for cropland, regional residents demonstrated no advantage. Where we did find evidence for local knowledge aiding classification performance, the realized impact of this effect was tiny. Rather, the inherent difficulty of a task is a much more important predictor of volunteer performance. These findings suggest that, at least for simple tasks, the geographical origin of VGI volunteers has little impact on their ability to complete image classifications.},
annote = {Statistic analysis

Volunteers showed small, but significant, differences in classification accuracy between their home
country and other countries. Of the 253 volunteers who rated at least 1000 points and at least 10 points in their home country, mean accuracy was 92.12{\%} at home and 91.41{\%} in other countries. Although small, this difference was statistically strong (two-tailed binomial test, 146 successes on 253 trials, p = 0.017).

The 337 volunteers with at least 1000 total ratings averaged 91.35{\%} agreement for images from their home continent and 91.30{\%} on other continents (two-tailed binomial test, 175 successes on 337 trials, p = 0.513).},

abstract = {This paper introduces architectural and interaction patterns for integrating crowdsourced human contributions directly into user interfaces. We focus on writing and editing, com-plex endeavors that span many levels of conceptual and pragmatic activity. Authoring tools offer help with pragmat-ics, but for higher-level help, writers commonly turn to other people. We thus present Soylent, a word processing interface that enables writers to call on Mechanical Turk workers to shorten, proofread, and otherwise edit parts of their docu-ments on demand. To improve worker quality, we introduce the Find-Fix-Verify crowd programming pattern, which splits tasks into a series of generation and review stages. Evaluation studies demonstrate the feasibility of crowdsourced editing and investigate questions of reliability, cost, wait time, and work time for edits.},

abstract = {Microtask crowdsourcing is increasingly critical to the cre-ation of extremely large datasets. As a result, crowd work-ers spend weeks or months repeating the exact same tasks — making it necessary to understand their behavior over these long periods of time. We utilize three large, longitudi-nal datasets of nine million annotations collected from Ama-zon Mechanical Turk to examine claims that workers fatigue or satisfice over these long periods, producing lower quality work. We find that, contrary to these claims, workers are ex-tremely stable in their accuracy over the entire period. To understand whether workers set their accuracy based on the task's requirements for acceptance, we then perform an ex-periment where we vary the required accuracy for a large crowdsourcing task. Workers did not adjust their accuracy based on the acceptance threshold: workers who were above the threshold continued working at their usual quality level, and workers below the threshold self-selected themselves out of the task. Capitalizing on this consistency, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict workers' long-term accuracy us-ing just a glimpse of their performance on the first five tasks.},

@article{Fan2014,
abstract = {In the past two years, several applications of generating three-dimensional (3D) buildings from OpenStreetMap (OSM) have been made available, for instance, OSM-3D, OSM2World, OSM Building, etc. In these projects, 3D buildings are reconstructed using the buildings' footprints and information about their attributes, which are documented as tags in OSM. Therefore, the quality of 3D buildings relies strongly on the quality of the building footprints data in OSM. This article is dedicated to a quality assessment of building footprints data in OSM for the German city of Munich, which is one of the most developed cities in OSM. The data are evaluated in terms of completeness, semantic accuracy, position accuracy, and shape accuracy by using building footprints in ATKIS (German Authority Topographic–Cartographic Information System) as reference data. The process contains three steps: finding correspondence between OSM and ATKIS data, calculating parameters of the four quality criteria, and statistical analysis. The results show that OSM footprint data in Munich have a high completeness and semantic accuracy. There is an offset of about four meters on average in terms of position accuracy. With respect to shape, OSM building footprints have a high similarity to those in ATKIS data. However, some architectural details are missing; hence, the OSM footprints can be regarded as a simplified version of those in ATKIS data.},
