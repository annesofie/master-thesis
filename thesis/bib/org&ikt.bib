Examining the effect of the changing cartography has on data collection using OSM crowdsourcing as a case study. Are parallels to what is happening with data collection in other aspects, like WIKIPEDIA, Flickr and YouTube. 
  
Today: A need for instant information, particularly in crisis situations 
User Generated Content providers / crowdsourced data collectors are allowed to collect geodata 
Reason: More available satellite imagery, cheaper GPS units, etc 
OSM the leading global example 
OSM was the first online mapping service to accurately map and display the new London Heathrow Terminal 5, on the official opening day. 
OSM project (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/No:Main{\_}Page) - the achieved coverage, its accuracy, availability and global impact are all changing the way individuals and org are thinking about the collection, purchase and use of geodata. 
Makes OSM stand out from other data sources: 
Completely free of charge 
Is released under a license which allows you to do pretty much what you like 
As long as you mention the original creator and the license 
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap{\_}License 
The availability, accuracy and price of OSM data has lead some local authorities in the UK to question the need to have total reliance on being locked into a contract for their geodata with the National Mapping Agency. 
OSM gives the possibility of having really current data available, other services may have a large lead for getting the data from survey to map output. 
OSM have specialist maps for cycling, routing, applications, skiing, topography and for maritime use.},

abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a volunteer-driven, globally distributed organization whose members work to create a common digital map of the world. OSM embraces ideals of open data, and to that end innovates both socially and technically to develop practices and processes for coordinated operation. This paper provides a brief history of OSM and then, through quantitative and qualitative examination of the OSM database and other sites of articulation work, examines organizational growth through the lens of two catastrophes that spurred enormous humanitarian relief responses—the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda. The temporally- and geographically- constrained events scope analysis for what is a rapidly maturing, whole-planet operation. The first disaster identified how OSM could support other organizations responding to the event. However, to achieve this, OSM has had to refine mechanisms of collaboration around map creation, which were tested again in Typhoon Yolanda. The transformation of work between these two events yields insights into the organizational development of large, data-producing online organizations.},

@article{Soden,
abstract = {The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010 catalyzed a nas-cent set of efforts in then-emergent ''volunteer technology communities.'' Among these was the response from OpenStreetMap, a volunteer-driven project that makes geospatial data free and openly available. Following the earthquake, remotely located volunteers rapidly mapped the affected areas to support the aid effort in a remarkable display of crowdsourced work. However, some within that effort believed that the impact and import of open and collaborative mapping techniques could provide much richer value to humanitarian aid work and the long-term development needs of the country. They launched an ambitious project that trialed methods for how to create sustainable and locally-owned community-mapping ecosystems in at-risk regions of the world. This paper describes how an organi-zation that emerged out of the response—the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team—formalized their practices in relation to many different stakeholder needs with the aim for setting a model for how the potential of participatory, community mapping could be realized in Haiti and beyond.},

@article{Givoni2016,
abstract = {Crisis mapping is a new modality of participatory humanitarian action in which global publics are mobilized to trace digital maps of disaster-stricken sites and to classify, verify, and plot on maps Big Data produced by disaster-affected people. This article untangles the political rationalities behind this emergent form of digital humanitarianism by looking at two platforms that shape the self-organizing crowds in which crisis mapping is grounded: MicroMappers, a microtasking platform for processing messages from disaster zones, and the Missing Maps Project, which traces maps of disaster-prone areas in poor countries. While looking at the increasingly prominent interplay between device-based participation and technologies of advanced liberal governance in humanitarianism, I make two interrelated claims. First, I argue that ICTs do not promote the democratization of disaster response as much as they put at its disposal new tools for establishing order and security in crisis zones by facilitating the transfer of responsibility to humanitarian crowds. Second, I claim that the emergence of the crowd as a new humanitarian actor that serves the dual and potentially incommensurate purposes of resilience and witnessing perpetuates the ambiguities of a humanitarian endeavor whose inherent tensions had grown deeper since it gained its current political prominence. Since its breakthrough following the Haiti earthquake (2010), crisis mapping has become established as a promising new avenue of both disaster management and humanitarian engagement. Described as a citizen-based and democratized creation of ''live,'' ''dynamic,'' and ''interactive'' maps that capture the unfolding of everything ''from slow-burn crises to sudden-onset disasters'' (Meier, 2011, 2012), crisis mapping has been repeatedly applied around the world to digitally trace maps of building, roads, displaced people's camps and medical facilities in the wake of disaster, to aggregate and plot on maps Big Data reports on humanitarian needs, and to assess damages based on aerial imagery. Following its tentative beginnings in the Haiti quake, when thousands of volunteers mobilized to make sense of the huge volume of data that flowed from the country via social media and text messages as well as to trace the most detailed street map of Haiti ever created, crisis mapping has become embedded in a global apparatus that encompasses international agencies, nonprofit tech companies, academic institutions, open source volunteer networks, and business corporations. In the weeks following the earthquake in Nepal in April 2015, for example, more than 4000 volunteers added over 13,199 mile of roads to the OpenStreetMap map of Nepal in an effort coordinated by the local Kathmandu Living Labs; at least nine teams flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operated in the country to produce up-to-date aerial imagery of damages; six million tweets were automatically processed in search of relevant info; and no less than 52 different crisis maps were created by a plethora of governmental, business, and grassroots actors.},

@article{Grutter2011,
abstract = {The wide availability of technologies such as GPS, map services and social networks, has resulted in the proliferation of geospatial data on the Web. In addition to material produced by professionals (e.g., maps), the public has also been encouraged to make geospatial content, including their geographical location, available online. The volume of such user-generated geospatial content is constantly growing. Similarly, the Linked Open Data cloud includes an increasing number of data sources with geospatial properties. The geo-referencing of Web resources and users has given rise to various services and applications that exploit it. With the location of users being made available widely, new issues such as those pertaining to security and privacy arise. Likewise, emergency response, context sensitive user applications, and complex GIS tasks all lend themselves toward Geospatial Semantic Web solutions. Researchers have been quick to realize the importance of these developments and have started working on the relevant research problems, giving rise to new topical research areas such as "Geographic Information Retrieval", "Geospatial (Semantic) Web", "Linked Geospatial Data", "GeoWeb 2.0". Similarly, standardization bodies such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) have been developing relevant standards such as the Geography Markup Language (GML) and GeoSPARQL. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, as well as interested parties from industry and government, to advance the frontiers of this exciting research area. Bringing together Semantic Web and geospatial researchers helps encourage the use of semantics in geospatial applications and the use of spatial elements in semantic research and applications thereby advancing the Geospatal Web},

abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) development is often characterized as a fundamen-tally new way to develop software. Past analyses and discussions, however, have treated OSS projects and their organization mostly as a static phenomenon. Consequently, we do not know how these communities of software developers are sustained and reproduced over time through the progressive integration of new members. To shed light on this issue I report on my analyses of socialization in a particular OSS community. In particular, I document the rela-tionships OSS newcomers develop over time with both the social and material aspects of a project. To do so, I combine two mutually informing activities: ethnography and the use of software specially designed to visualize and explore the interacting networks of human and material resources incorporated in the email and code databases of OSS. Socialization in this community is analyzed from two perspectives: as an individual learning process and as a political process. From these analyses it appears that successful participants progressively construct identities as software craftsmen, and that this process is punctuated by specific rites of passage. Successful participants also understand the political nature of software develop-ment and progressively enroll a network of human and material allies to support their efforts. I conclude by discussing how these results could inform the design of software to support socialization in OSS projects, as well as practical implications for the future of these projects.},

abstract = {Advances in positioning, Web mapping, cellular communications and wiki technologies have outpaced the original visions of GSDI programs around the world. By tapping the distributed knowledge, personal time and energy of volunteer contributors, GI voluntarism is beginning to relocate and redistribute selected GI productive activities from mapping agencies to networks of non-state volunteer actors. Participants in the production process are both users and producers, or 'produsers' to use a recent neologism. Indeed, GI voluntarism ultimately has the potential to redistribute the rights to define and judge the value of the produced geographic information and of the new production system in general. The concept and its implementation presents a rich collection of both opportunities and risks now being considered by leaders of public and private mapping organizations world-wide. In this paper, the authors describe and classify both the types of people who volunteer geospatial information and the nature of their contributions. Combining empirical research dealing with the Open Source software and Wikipedia communities with input from selected national mapping agencies and private companies, the authors propose a taxonomy of voluntary geospatial information contributors. Differentiating between three different contexts in which these volunteer contributors operate – market-driven, social networking, and civic/governmental – the authors describe key opportunities, constraints and factors to consider in each case when determining whether and how to assess information provided by such sources.},

However, while this number of contributors seems impressive, questions remain about the individual contributions that have been made by the project members. This research article contains several studies regarding the contributions by the community of the project. The results show that only 38{\%} (192,000) of the registered members carried out at least one edit in the OSM database and that only 5{\%} (24,000) of all members actively contributed to the project in a more productive way. The majority of the members are located in Europe (72{\%}) and each member has an activity area whose size may range from one soccer field up to more than 50 km2. In addition to several more analyses conducted for this article, predictions will be made about how this newly acquired knowledge can be used for future research.},

Despite the difficulties imposed by distance, these projects have managed to produce large, complex, and successful systems. However, there is still little known about how open-source teams manage their collaboration. In this paper we look at one aspect of this issue: how distributed developers maintain group awareness. We interviewed developers, read project communication, and looked at project artifacts from three successful open source projects. We found that distributed developers do need to maintain awareness of one another, and that they maintain both a general awareness of the entire team and more detailed knowledge of people that they plan to work with. Although there are several sources of information, this awareness is maintained primarily through text-based communication (mailing lists and chat systems). These textual channels have several characteristics that help to support the maintenance of awareness, as long as developers are committed to reading the lists and to making their project communication public.},
