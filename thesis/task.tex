\section*{Background}
Micro-tasking is an Internet phenomenon that has increased in popularity over the last years. The method is used for solving large tasks that can be divided into many smaller ones (micro-tasks).  This involves both the use of computers and a large number of people. Importing geospatial data over large areas can be considered as a large task. This is a task that can be divided into smaller ones, for example by dividing into smaller areas.

\section*{Task Description}

This Master thesis will have an emphasis on the data validation and conflict handling part of the import of geospatial data. These processes are too complicated to do fully automatic through scripts, and the thesis investigates how micro-tasking can be a relevant approach to the problem. 
Specific tasks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Study related literature
	\item Make a web-based experiment in order to answer the following questions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What are the number of objects optimal within a micro-task to get it completed as quickly as possible?
		\item Does the quality of the work vary between the different tasks given?
		\item Do amateurs manage to do the tasks?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Explore the micro-tasking methods usage potential within geospatial data
\end{itemize}

\section*{Administrative/guidance}
The work on the Master Thesis starts on January 18th, 2017

The thesis report as described above shall be submitted digitally in DAIM at the latest at June 18th, 2017
